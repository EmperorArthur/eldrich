# Eldrich Host
Should probably explain WTF's going on.

## Setup
This needs a Drupal instance in the drupal directory. Symlink `./drupal/modules/custom` to the `./modules` directory and you'll be happy. Also remember to tell Drupal's `settings.php` file that the config sync directory is up a level, in `./config/sync`.

## Development
Eh, I dunno? I'm setting up a Vagrantfile.
