The Expanse,"The Expanse is set in a future in which humanity has colonized much of the Solar System, but does not have the means to travel to other systems. In the asteroid belt and beyond, tensions are rising between Earth's United Nations, Mars, and the outer planets.

The series initially takes place in our solar system, using many real world locations such as Ceres and Eros in the asteroid belt, several moons of Jupiter, with Ganymede and Europa the most developed and small science bases as far out as Phoebe around Saturn and Titania around Uranus. There are also well established, domed settlements on Mars and the Moon.

Central to the series is the existence of The Protomolecule, an advanced alien terraforming tool that arrived in our solar system billions of years ago aboard a Bracewall probe. Much like the Exsurgent Virus, it’s capable of infecting and transforming biological life forms it encounters, using them to build strange and inhuman structures.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8X5gXIQmY-E,https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/87325424/eldrich-images/inspiration/the-expanse.jpg,"http://www.jamessacorey.com/books/

Global Frequency,"The Global Frequency is an independent, covert intelligence organization headed by a former intelligence agent who uses the alias of Miranda Zero. There are reportedly 1,001 people on the Global Frequency, forming an active smart mob communicating by specially modified video mobile phones through a central dispatch system coordinated by a young woman code-named Aleph.

The purpose of the organization is to protect and rescue the world from the consequences of the various secret projects that the governments or individuals of the world have established, which are unknown to the public at large. The people on the Global Frequency are chosen and called on for their specialized skills in a variety of areas, and include military personnel, intelligence agents, police detectives, scientific researchers, academics, athletes, former criminals and assassins. The threats addressed by the organization are equally varied and usually world-threatening, including rogue military operations, paranormal phenomena, terrorist attacks and religious cults.

The existence of the organization is an open secret, but its membership list is anonymous, the identities of its field agents unknown to even each other before they meet on a mission. Often the only way to tell a member of the Global Frequency is by the phones that they carry or the Global Frequency symbol—a circle with four points on its perimeter 90 degrees apart—that they sport somewhere on their person.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EShP8FbVW_k,https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/87325424/eldrich-images/inspiration/global-frequency.jpg,
