Who in the what now?,12/9/16 7:00 AM,"So, Eclipse Phase is a fantastic tabletop roleplaying game by Posthuman Studios. It’s… post-apocalyptic transhumanist sci-fi horror? Which I think is setting some adjective records, but is solidly fantastic. The problem is that it’s often tough for new players to get their bearings: dozens of skills, hundreds of traits and augmentations that can modify a character’s performance in tweaky ways, huge lists of purchasable equipment, and a gear system that makes all of your physical characteristics as malleable as your clothing.

The cool news is that Posthuman Studios has released Eclipse Phase under a Creative Commons license, and the underlying stats, rules, gear, and more can be remixed, sliced and diced, and presented in cool ways by the community. That’s what Eldrich Host is — a tool for browsing and making sense of not just individual bits of information (“What’s the ‘downtime’ sleight?”) but also the inter-relationships between those bits of information (“Does this augmentation increase a stat that any of my current weapons benefit from?”).

It’s still very much in progress, but this early alpha version supports a lot of the core information: a catalog of gear, a list of skills, traits, and more… even a first pass at an Eclipse Phase ‘bestiary’ of critters and robots that players are likely to encounter. There’s still a lot to do, but it’s fun getting there — and my gaming group’s already using it.

If you’re new to Eclipse Phase? Take a look around. If you like the looks of it, be sure to purchase print or digital copies of Posthuman Studios’ books: their generosity and commitment to the Creative Commons is what makes this project possible."
Equipped Weapons and more…,12/10/16 10:00 PM,"This weekend’s big update is an “equipped weapons” mechanism. A weapon, any number of mods, an ammo type, and any number of smart ammo features, can all be combined into a single “equipment” entry for a creature, robot, etc. Although it doesn’t do much at the moment, it lays the groundwork for accurate calculation of a given weapon’s damage and target skill roll in the future.

When full-fledged support for NPC and Player Character records rolls out, this will make it much easier to generate quick reference cards for a given weapon, and to generate “official-looking” NPC cards that match the presentation style used in the core books."
A few creatures,12/12/16 10:00 PM,"A few sample creatures, complete with equipped weapons, can now be seen in the World / Bestiary section of the site. Before filling in any more of those pieces, I’ll be working to complete the NPC and PC Character handling — as well as some tidier presentation for the complicated content types. The long-term goal is to make quick reference work easy, and that requires making it readable!"
First pass at NPCs,12/16/16 6:00 PM,"Progress marches on. With weapons and armor in place, the “identity block” and morph instance handling necessary for NPCs and characters is now in place. The way Eldrich is set up, NPCs are intended to be (fairly) quick to set up. You set up the stats and skills, for example, but don’t have to fill out all kinds of morph-specific information in order to produce a functional character sheet. Skills entered into an NPC record are treated as ‘straight’ skills — they’re displayed as-is without any smart totaling based on core abilities or bonuses.

Full-fledged character sheets, however, store that skill information as “points” added to a character’s record. They’re totaled up with base skills, morph bonuses, trait and augmentation bonuses, etc before they’re actually shown to a visitor browsing on the site. That makes it easier to do things like switching out the morph on a PC, then automatically retooling their final scores.

All of this to say, it’s been a very nerdy couple of evenings."
The Christmas Update,12/24/16 4:00 PM,"Here’s where it starts getting fun. Automatic calculation of weapon effects and damage output (accounting for weapon mods, ammo, and smart ammo features) is now finished. So is auto-calculation of total armor values based on base morph armor, augmentations, worn armor, and armor mods. For PC and preteen characters, aggregation of effective ability and skill values based on core stats, augmentations and traits, equipment bonuses, and so on? Also done. In addition, special effects like ‘shock’ or ‘pain’ are hyperlinked to quick explanations of their rules, for folks like me who always forget the basics.

Another pass back through the underlying data will be necessary to make sure that things are good now that we’re actually doing more STUFF with it. The end result, though? You should be able to pop open an NPC or Pregen character in Eldrich and have a usable quick reference for the gaming table."
Ringing in the new year,1/1/17 3:00 PM,"Things are humming along nicely; some minor changes to the model have been made so that future non-canon materials can be attributed to the campaigns they originated from, and templating tweaks have made the site a lot more attractive over the holidays.

The really big news, though, is the fully populated compliment of NPCs from the core books, as well as proper weapon and armor totaling, conditional attribute bonus display, and so on. There’s even an experimental “Threat Rating” on every NPC and creature now, taking into account their general durability and offensive potential. It’s not too smart about ranking things that don’t have actual combat weapons — all infomorphs show up with a threat rating of zero, for example — but generally speaking, it can help GMs figure out whether the thugs and zenofauna they’re throwing at a group are a cakewalk or a potential party-wipe.

Next up? Full character sheet generation…"
Under the hood improvements,1/7/17 8:00 PM,"The whole full-character-generation thing was a little ambitious; although a lot of progress has been made on the invisible stuff that enables that step, the actual templates are still on the way. In the meantime, more work is being done on some of the structural content types that will be used to track in-progress games. In addition, some heartfelt soul-searching led to the realization that a couple of details — specifically skill point allocation for NPCs and one-off native attack definition for creatures — are crap, utter crap, and must be refactored.

Only the best for you, my nerdlings."
Shiny new presentation,1/13/17 11:00 AM,"With skill point allocation all squared away, the time to tidy up the site’s presentation of individual resources has come. Weapons, Drugs, Morphs, and other data-intensive items look more consistent; creatures, NPCs, and player characters display more of their information on the default layouts; an enhanced ‘charsheet’ view of all PCs and NPCs is now available for those who want a detailed look at point breakdowns; and some subtle things, like Psi attacks and Unarmed attacks for characters with no weapons, have been added to attacks display. In addition, if a morph has multiple mobility modes (say, walking and flying speed) both appear. Like magic.

Next step? Bashing out an overview page for Campaigns and Gaming sessions, where GMs can generate quick reference sheets with every players’ skill checks. Because awwwww yeah."
And on and on,1/22/17 2:30 PM,"Welp, this weekend's round of updates includes some nice features:

The gear catalog is a little better organized — in particular, the ""tree"" of equipment actually makes sense now, although some of the augmentations from later sourcebooks need to be recategorized to avoid cluttering up the general ""augmentations"" section. There there are overview pages for a couple of the more popular categories of gear, like  http://eldrich.host/gear/weapons and http://eldrich.host/gear/morphs — although the morphs page in particular feels like it doesn't include *enough* information to make the overview useful. We'll see.

The Stats section, with sleights and traits and mental trauma info and skills, has been tidied up and now lends itself better to browsing. The ""World"" section doesn't look too much different, but the Character Sheet view that was mentioned in the previous update is now accessible from the normal NPC page — on http://eldrich.host/world/npcs/jovian-soldier for example, the link is now in the sidebar. Printer-friendly versions of the stylesheets are in place as well, hiding extraneous info so that printing off a quick copy of a character sheet results in something that's actually useful at the gaming table.

What's coming next? Finally fleshing out the ""Games"" section, with pages for in-progress campaigns, links and downloadable resources for each campaign's players, and the ability to clone an existing NPC as the starting point for a new campaign-specific character. Mmmmmmm."
"Cleaner look, more fluff",2/5/17 6:30 PM,"After a longer-than-usual period of silence, the latest round of updates is in! This week’s rev includes the final batch of NPCs from Firewall, Sunward, and Mind The WMDs — as well as images of every morph and most NPCs. Gear browsing has received a few minor tweaks as well, but no one cares at this point.

Custom Campaigns now display their associated players as well as any homebrew gear and fluff that’s been associated with them. For the terminally lazy GM each campaign can now spit out a randomized combat initiative list for all of its associated PCs, as well as a table of skills and common checks values for all PCs. Finally, a new “Inspiration” content type can be used to group together a bunch of homebrew NPCs, factions, etc that share a common origin. Don’t tell anyone, but that feature is why I built the whole site: Eldrich Host is just a giant, over-engineered place to post NPCs from my favorite Kdrama."
Creatures squared away,2/12/17 2:00 PM,"One of the biggest remaining pieces of canon stat material was creatures — all the assorted aliens and critters and nasty things that pop up in various books. After some schema twiddling and a lot of data entry, they’re all there: the Bestiary is now much deeper, and the remaining smart animals finally have their full skill blocks, to boot.

One problem, however, is that the automatic Threat Rating calculator is bad at weighting many of the unique skills that make exsurgents and creatures so dangerous. Nanoswarms, for example, don’t strike it as very dangerous because they don’t carry guns and armor — nevermind the fact that they’re basically invulnerable to damage and can disassemble anything you throw at them. It’s not a huge deal, but it’s kicking around in the back of my head as other game-related enhancements get some attention."
