Who in the what now?,12/9/16 7:00 AM,"So, Eclipse Phase is a fantastic tabletop roleplaying game by Posthuman Studios. It’s… post-apocalyptic transhumanist sci-fi horror? Which I think is setting some adjective records, but is solidly fantastic. The problem is that it’s often tough for new players to get their bearings: dozens of skills, hundreds of traits and augmentations that can modify a character’s performance in tweaky ways, huge lists of purchasable equipment, and a gear system that makes all of your physical characteristics as malleable as your clothing.

The cool news is that Posthuman Studios has released Eclipse Phase under a Creative Commons license, and the underlying stats, rules, gear, and more can be remixed, sliced and diced, and presented in cool ways by the community. That’s what Eldrich Host is — a tool for browsing and making sense of not just individual bits of information (“What’s the ‘downtime’ sleight?”) but also the inter-relationships between those bits of information (“Does this augmentation increase a stat that any of my current weapons benefit from?”).

It’s still very much in progress, but this early alpha version supports a lot of the core information: a catalog of gear, a list of skills, traits, and more… even a first pass at an Eclipse Phase ‘bestiary’ of critters and robots that players are likely to encounter. There’s still a lot to do, but it’s fun getting there — and my gaming group’s already using it.

If you’re new to Eclipse Phase? Take a look around. If you like the looks of it, be sure to purchase print or digital copies of Posthuman Studios’ books: their generosity and commitment to the Creative Commons is what makes this project possible."
Equipped Weapons and more…,12/10/16 10:00 PM,"This weekend’s big update is an “equipped weapons” mechanism. A weapon, any number of mods, an ammo type, and any number of smart ammo features, can all be combined into a single “equipment” entry for a creature, robot, etc. Although it doesn’t do much at the moment, it lays the groundwork for accurate calculation of a given weapon’s damage and target skill roll in the future.

When full-fledged support for NPC and Player Character records rolls out, this will make it much easier to generate quick reference cards for a given weapon, and to generate “official-looking” NPC cards that match the presentation style used in the core books."
A few creatures,12/12/16 10:00 PM,"A few sample creatures, complete with equipped weapons, can now be seen in the World / Bestiary section of the site. Before filling in any more of those pieces, I’ll be working to complete the NPC and PC Character handling — as well as some tidier presentation for the complicated content types. The long-term goal is to make quick reference work easy, and that requires making it readable!"
First pass at NPCs,12/16/16 6:00 PM,"Progress marches on. With weapons and armor in place, the “identity block” and morph instance handling necessary for NPCs and characters is now in place. The way Eldrich is set up, NPCs are intended to be (fairly) quick to set up. You set up the stats and skills, for example, but don’t have to fill out all kinds of morph-specific information in order to produce a functional character sheet. Skills entered into an NPC record are treated as ‘straight’ skills — they’re displayed as-is without any smart totaling based on core abilities or bonuses.

Full-fledged character sheets, however, that skill information as “points” added to a character’s record. They’re totaled up with base skills, morph bonuses, trait and augmentation bonuses, etc before they’re actually shown to a visitor browsing on the site. That makes it easier to do things like switching out the morph on a PC, then automatically retooling their final scores.

All of this to say, it’s been a very nerdy couple of evenings."
The Christmas Update,12/24/16 4:00 PM,"Here’s where it starts getting fun. Automatic calculation of weapon effects and damage output (accounting for weapon mods, ammo, and smart ammo features) is now finished. So is auto-calculation of total armor values based on base morph armor, augmentations, worn armor, and armor mods. For PC and preteen characters, aggregation of effective ability and skill values based on core stats, augmentations and traits, equipment bonuses, and so on? Also done. In addition, special effects like ‘shock’ or ‘pain’ are hyperlinked to quick explanations of their rules, for folks like me who always forget the basics.

Another pass back through the underlying data will be necessary to make sure that things are good now that we’re actually doing more STUFF with it. The end result, though? You should be able to pop open an NPC or Pregen character in Eldrich and have a usable quick reference for the gaming table."
Ringing in the new year,1/1/17 3:00 PM,"Things are humming along nicely; some minor changes to the model have been made so that future non-canon materials can be attributed to the campaigns they originated from, and templating tweaks have made the site a lot more attractive over the holidays.

The really big news, though, is the fully populated compliment of NPCs from the core books, as well as proper weapon and armor totaling, conditional attribute bonus display, and so on. There’s even an experimental “Threat Rating” on every NPC and creature now, taking into account their general durability and offensive potential. It’s not too smart about ranking things that don’t have actual combat weapons — all infomorphs show up with a threat rating of zero, for example — but generally speaking, it can help GMs figure out whether the thugs and zenofauna they’re throwing at a group are a cakewalk or a potential party-wipe.
