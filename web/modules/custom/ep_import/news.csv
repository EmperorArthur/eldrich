12/9/16 7:00 AM,Who in the what now?,"So, Eclipse Phase is a fantastic tabletop roleplaying game by Posthuman Studios. It’s… post-apocalyptic transhumanist sci-fi horror? Which I think is setting some adjective records, but is solidly fantastic. The problem is that it’s often tough for new players to get their bearings: dozens of skills, hundreds of traits and augmentations that can modify a character’s performance in tweaky ways, huge lists of purchasable equipment, and a gear system that makes all of your physical characteristics as malleable as your clothing.

The cool news is that Posthuman Studios has released Eclipse Phase under a Creative Commons license, and the underlying stats, rules, gear, and more can be remixed, sliced and diced, and presented in cool ways by the community. That’s what Eldrich Host is — a tool for browsing and making sense of not just individual bits of information (“What’s the ‘downtime’ sleight?”) but also the inter-relationships between those bits of information (“Does this augmentation increase a stat that any of my current weapons benefit from?”).

It’s still very much in progress, but this early alpha version supports a lot of the core information: a catalog of gear, a list of skills, traits, and more… even a first pass at an Eclipse Phase ‘bestiary’ of critters and robots that players are likely to encounter. There’s still a lot to do, but it’s fun getting there — and my gaming group’s already using it.

If you’re new to Eclipse Phase? Take a look around. If you like the looks of it, be sure to purchase print or digital copies of Posthuman Studios’ books: their generosity and commitment to the Creative Commons is what makes this project possible."

A weapon, any number of mods, an ammo type, and any number of smart ammo features, can all be combined into a single “equipment” entry for a creature, robot, etc. Although it doesn’t do much at the moment, it lays the groundwork for accurate calculation of a given weapon’s damage and target skill roll in the future.

When full-fledged support for NPC and Player Character records rolls out, this will make it much easier to generate quick reference cards for a given weapon, and to generate “official-looking” NPC cards that match the presentation style used in the core books."

Before filling in any more of those pieces, I’ll be working to complete the NPC and PC Character handling — as well as some tidier presentation for the complicated content types. The long-term goal is to make quick reference work easy, and that requires making it readable!"
