Tess Wiley,,Whiskey,Bohemian blackmailer,Night Cartel,"+Self Reliance, +Family Unity, -Debt","Darling, you positively MUST.","Tall and lithe, with a thick head of raven curls and a sly smirk. If she thinks someone’s bullshitting her, she’ll arch an eyebrow, listen, and keep feeding them rope. Her morph sports a holographic projector meant to enhance her appearance with impressive environmental effects, but she often abuses during conversations. If she disagrees with someone, they’ll probably find biting commentary floating overhead while they’re talking.

Tess is a social butterfly trying to keep Whiskey’s inexplicable live theater community from evaporating: the local market is slim, but the group scrapes by selling well-reviewed XP recordings of their productions. She’s always on the lookout for patrons and publicity, but it’s a mystery why she’s trying to make it on Whiskey rather than move to the inner system.

To those in the know, she’s also a cat’s paw for Anthony Gillotti, Whiskey’s resident smuggler and power broker. Gillotti keeps her theater’s lights on, and she wines and dines his guests. While she does, she gathers blackmail material, plants backdoors, and acts as a discreet messenger. Her quick command of social situations and her reputation as a broke bohemian artist are often enough to get her out of tricky situations.","Tess’s real name is “Miriam Reis.” Her father, Caleb Reis, was a network security specialist protecting one of Chicago’s last farcasters from constant TITAN hacks. When his wife was killed in an attack, he pulled strings to secure his 19-year-old daughter time to ego-cast off planet. Miriam spent years doing scut work on Luna and Mars, occasionally using her UofC theater training. She remained convinced that her father made it off Earth.

Four years ago, she followed a lead on a Main Belt data storage facility that may have received Caleb’s uploaded ego before Chicago was destroyed. It turned out to be a cover for a Nine Lives forknapping ring, and several memory-wiped Beta Forks of Caleb were being rented out as a mesh intrusion team. She called in every favor, burnt every last bit of rep, and went deep into debt to orchestrate a jailbreak—convincing the sponsors it would be a lucrative heist.

She and the team she hired rescued one of the forks and burnt the Nine Lives network housing the backups. As a result of the rescue, she’s on Nine Lives’ shit list and is deeper in debt to Anthony Gillotti than she’ll ever be able to repay. Fortunately, she and Caleb — now ‘Daniel’ — are useful enough that he helps protect them.

Tess is fiercely protective of Daniel, but tries hard to remain distant: she secretly hopes to find the original backup that his memory-wiped fork was created from. If that happens, she knows that Daniel might have to be sacrificed.","COG:15, COO:15, INT:15, REF:15, SAV:20, SOM:15, WIL:15, MOX:3, SPD:1","Dependent, Intense Relationship:Daniel Oliver, Information Control, Debt (Level 3), On The Run:Nine Lives","Deception 60, Exotic Melee Weapon: Monowire Garotte 60, Fray 65, Free Fall 60, Impersonation 30, Infiltration 70, Kinesics 55, Networking 30 (Autonomists), Networking (Criminals) 65, Networking 40 (Media), Palming 55, Perception 65, Persuasion 60, Protocol 50, Unarmed Combat 50, Academics: Film History 30, Art: Performance 45, Art: Theater Production 55, Interest: Celebrity Gossip 65, Interest: Wine 55, Language: English 85, Language: Mandarin 45, Professional: Social Engineering 45",,Sylph,"COO:5, SAV:10, WIL:5, DUR:35",Striking Looks,"Access Jacks, Basic Mesh Inserts, Cortical Stack, Basic Biomods, Clean Metabolism, Enhanced Pheromones, Enhanced Smell, Holographic Projector, Endocrine Control, Ghostrider Module, Puppet Sock, Bioware Claws",,"Smart Cat: Neko, Tactical Network, Active ID Protection, Prisoner Mask",Bioware Claws; Monowire Garrote,Smart Clothing,,,"@:5,f:35,g:10",TRUE,
Daniel Oliver,,Whiskey,Infugee combat hacker,Night Cartel,"+Stability, +Conspiracy Theories, -Indenture","If you consider the secret Jovian base on Luna, the whole theory makes perfect sense.","Daniel’s usual AR avatar is a scruffy eastern european male. However, he’s also been known to appear in meetings as an over-the-top pigtailed anime character in the Moé or Waifu style. Given his fondness for burner Ectos and fabricated mesh IDs even during casual interactions, odds are good that any resident of Whiskey has interacted with Daniel without realizing it.

Daniel Oliver is nominally employed as a security consultant for Anthony’s import/export business, but he frequently serves as a combat hacker for hits and espionage jobs. Like Tess, he’s deep in debt to Anthony for the exotic array of software and Infomorph upgrades that help him do his work.

Many believe believe he “lives” on a high security server in Anthony’s private network. That entity is actually a decoy fork—what Daniel considers his “true self” resides on a hidden ghostrider module in Tess WIley’s morph. The two run high-risk info theft jobs for Anthony, as well as the occasional third party. They work together like well-oiled machine. Many people know the two are friends, some know they work together, but only a small handful know about the ghostrider module.","Daniel is an illegal beta fork of Caleb Reis, Tess Wiley’s father. He worked as a combat hacker and network security specialist during the Fall, holding o  TITAN attacks at key farcasting facilities during the evacuation of Earth. Nine Lives recovered his ego backup from a forgotten data cache in Earth Orbit, then created a large pool of forks to rent out as slave-hackers once they discovered his skills.

He’s not aware of this past, though, and all memories of his life before working in the Nine Lives info-mill have been wiped out. As far as he knows, Tess “freed” him during an info theft job at a Nine Lives facility, and they’r enow working to jointly pay off the debt. It’s a better deal than he’d have gotten from Nine Lives, obviously.

Daniel knows he’s good at what he does, but also understands that he’s crippled. His core aptitudes and skills were pruned in the forking process, and despite his missing memories he understands that his “real” self must have been the best of the best. It gnaws at him, and he’s prone to showing off. He projects a disaffected, “I’m just here for a good time” vibe, but when he’s working it’s clear that he takes his job very, very seriously.

He takes risks, often foolish ones, and he’s prone to paranoia and conspiracy theories—especially when he suspects that his missing memories or skills might have been important for a job. His only personal confidant is Tess, who keeps him at arms length despite their close working relationship.","COG:20, COO:5, INT:15, REF:5, SAV:15, SOM:5, WIL:10, MOX:1, SPD:1","Beta, Edited Memories, Mental Disorder: Impulse Control, Digital Ghost, Intuitive Cracker","Deception 55, Hardware: Electronics 50, Gunnery 40, Infosec 60, Interfacing 60, Investigation 60, Kinesics 25, Navigation 35, Networking: Criminals 45, Networking: Hypercorps 40, Perception 55, Pilot: Aircraft 35, Pilot: Spacecraft 40, Programming 60, Research 60, Academics: Computer Science 60, Academics: Cryptography 60, Interest: Criminal Groups 40, Interest: Peaty Scotch 45, Language: English 60, Professional: Data Mining 60, Professional: Mesh Security Ops 60",,Sage,"COG:10, SAV:5, SPD:2",,"Eidetic Memory, Hyper Linguist, Math Boost, Mnemonic Augmentation, Active Countermeasures",,"Fake Brainprint Plug-In, Relationship Mapping, Sniffer, Spoof, Exploit, AR Illusions, Tactical Network, Cauterizer, Shutter",,,,,"@:40,c:20,g:50,r:30",TRUE,
Anthony Gillotti,,Whiskey,Smuggling Mastermind,Night Cartel,"+Human Survival, +Earth Relics, -TITANs",I believe you’ll need to speak to my associates about that.,"A tall man in his mid-fifties with greying hair, a slight limp, and bit of weight around the middle. He’s gracious and confident, given to expansive gestures when he’s talking.

Anthony presents as an aging mafia don; his presence is intimidating, but he doesn’t look like a bruiser. Successful Kinesics checks will reveal that he’s a lot more limber than he looks, however. The weight around the middle is body armor, and the limp disappears when he really needs to move.

Anthony makes a show of owning a high-end pawnshop on Whiskey, stocked with a fortune in Earth relics. It’s unclear how much money he has, but he wines and dines Hypercorp visitors and representatives from various factions quite frequently. He even funds most of Whiskey’s improbably local arts scene.

He insists that “imports and exports” are his primary business, but everyone knows that his associates “protect” half of the outer ring. He’s helped keep Whiskey relatively peaceful, but those who cross him have “accidents” with alarming frequency. If you need to move dangerous or exotic artifacts, even contraband from a Gatecrashing mission, contacting him is a good first step.","Anthony established himself as a reliable, if somewhat disinterested, middleman in the pre-fall Mafia networks on Earth. During the evacuation, however, he kicked into high gear and took control of several disintegrating criminal gangs. He and his associates made it to the outer systems with a fortune in looted Earth antiques, which Anthony used as collateral to establish himself on Whiskey. Since then he’s consolidated his power and set himself up as a middleman. 

After a Jovian strike team nearly killed him several years ago, Anthony uses a heavily modified Guard Deluxe morph. Its Synthetic Mask augmentation mimics the appearance of his previous Splicer morph (-30 to detect the difference), and only his inner circle know of the change. The downside of his juiced up morph is a tendency to overheat: his offices and personal quarters are kept at a chilly 15C.

His personal guards are Michael and Gabriel, a pair of well-dressed Criminal Enforcers (NPC File Prime, page 7). They’re linked to his private TacNet along with a number of trusted lieutenants, and accompany him whenever he’s outside his private quarters.

Anthony is funneling the vast majority of his wealth into a black project: establishing a self-sufiicient colony in a distant habitable system, then cutting it off from transhumanity. He believes that Sol is doomed, and this “lifeboat” will be humanity’s last shot. A handful of close associates know small parts of the plan (he smuggles shipments through the Eros gate, his wealth is being siphoned off of Whiskey, etc), but not the big picture. 

Anthony is collected, hard to ruffle, and willing to dig out a cortical stack with his hands if it needs to be done. He can be cordial, even charming, and makes a show of “old-world” manners. He considers unnecessary violence a sign of weakness. Many think his interest in the arts is a way of flaunting his wealth, but it’s genuine, and reflects his desire to save “the best of us.”","COG:15, COO:15, INT:15, REF:10, SAV:15, SOM:20, WIL:25, MOX:3, SPD:1","Stalker:Obsessive journalist Alice Young, Black Mark: Double-crossed Jovian government","Beam Weapons 55, Deception 50, Fray 60, Intimidation 70, Kinesics 60, Networking: Autonomists 50, Networking: Criminals 85, Networking: Ecologists 50, Networking: Hypercorps 50, Networking: Scientists 55, Palming 50, Perception 65, Persuasion 70, Unarmed Combat 45, Interest: Opera 45, Interest: Antiques 55, Interest: Church History 60, Interest: Criminal Groups 60, Language: English 85, Language: Italian 55, Profession: Antiques Dealer 55, Profession: Smuggler 60",,Guard Deluxe,"COO:5, REF:5, SAV:5, SOM:10, DUR:50",Temperature Intolerance (Warm),"Access Jacks, Basic Mesh Inserts, Cortical Stack, Brain Box, Chemical Sniffer, Enhanced Vision, T-Ray Emitter, Lidar, Synthetic Mask, Neurachem (Level 1), Cyberclaws, Concealed Weapon Mount: Microwave Agonizer",,Tactical Network,Microwave Agonizer {Smartlink};Cyberclaws,Armor Clothing,,,"@:50,g:90,c:40,r:30,x:50",TRUE,
