Addiction (Major),-20,"Addiction comes in two forms: mental (affecting the ego) and physical (affecting the biomorph). The character or morph is addicted to a drug (p. 317), stimulus (XP), or activity (mesh use) to a degree that impacts the character's physical or mental health. Players and gamemasters should work together to agree on addictions that are appropriate for their game. Addiction comes in three levels of severity: minor, moderate, or major: Major: A character with a major addiction is on the rapid road to ruin. They face cravings every 6 hours, and suffer a -10 DUR penalty as their health is affected. If they fail to get their regular dosage, they suffer a -30 modifier on all actions until they do. If their life hasn't already been ruined by their obsession, it soon will be.",-30 to all actions without drugs,TRUE,TRUE,,,FALSE,
Addiction (Minor),-5,"Addiction comes in two forms: mental (affecting the ego) and physical (affecting the biomorph). The character or morph is addicted to a drug (p. 317), stimulus (XP), or activity (mesh use) to a degree that impacts the character's physical or mental health. Players and gamemasters should work together to agree on addictions that are appropriate for their game. Addiction comes in three levels of severity: minor, moderate, or major: Minor: A minor addiction is largely kept under control-it does not ruin the character's life, though it may create some difficulties. The character may not even recognize or admit they have a problem. The character must indulge the addiction at least once a week, though they can go for longer without too much difficulty. If they fail to get their weekly dose, they suffer a -10 modifier on all actions until they get their fix.",-10 to all actions without drugs,FALSE,TRUE,,,FALSE,
Addiction (Moderate),-10,"Addiction comes in two forms: mental (affecting the ego) and physical (affecting the biomorph). The character or morph is addicted to a drug (p. 317), stimulus (XP), or activity (mesh use) to a degree that impacts the character's physical or mental health. Players and gamemasters should work together to agree on addictions that are appropriate for their game. Addiction comes in three levels of severity: minor, moderate, or major: Moderate: A moderate addiction is in full swing. The character obviously has a problem, and must satisfy the addiction at least once a day. If they fail to do so, they may suffer mood swings, compulsive behavior, physical sickness, or other side effects until they indulge their craving. Apply a -20 modifier to all of the character's actions until they get their fix. Additionally, a character with this level of addiction suffers a -5 DUR penalty.",-20 to all actions without drugs,FALSE,TRUE,,,FALSE,
Aggressive GRM,-10,"This trait is generally only found on uplift biomorphs, but might be included on any unusual high-end or custom biomorphs. A much more aggressive version of the genetic rights management used in rusters and other morphs that require maintenance through GSPs (see Planned Obsolescence, p. 165, Sunward), the genehacking used in creating this morph is atypical and includes many sections of suppressed effects and potential problems that make it difficult for anyone not familiar with the initial design to modify the morph. Unless unlocked by the designer through further genehacking, this morph is sterile, and will reject any biomods not listed as standard for the morph. Worse, due to the extensive and limiting manipulation of the morph's DNA, it is much more prone to cancers and longevity issues than other morphs and has an average life expectancy of only 30-40 years. At the gamemaster's discretion, Medicine Tests to modify or even heal this morph may suffer modifiers ranging from -10 to -30.",,FALSE,TRUE,,,FALSE,
AGI Affinity,5,"The character has spent a significant amount of time around AGIs, to the point where socializing with an AGI is far easier. The character gains a +10 modifier on Social Skill Tests against AGIs as well as characters with the Real World Naivet√© trait.",+10 to AGI social tests,TRUE,FALSE,,,FALSE,
AGI Socialization,10,"Only AGI characters may take this trait and only during character generation. The character is more adept at interpreting social cues than the average infolife. The character gains a +10 bonus on all Kinesics Tests made against transhumans. This bonus does not apply to other AGIs, uplifts, aliens, or exsurgents.",+10 Kinesics against transhumans,TRUE,FALSE,,,FALSE,
Alien Biochemistry,0,"It is an impressive feat that creatures that evolved on separate worlds with different biochemistries are now being transformed into pods by transhuman geneticists. In fact, the biochemistries of these creatures are far less understood than that of transhumans. What this means is that drugs, chemicals, bioware augmentations, and cybernetic implants may have unpredictable effects on the pod. Drug treatments beneficial to transhumans may not function at all, for example, while something that transhumans regularly eat or handle may in fact be toxic to the pod and trigger an anaphylactic response. The gamemaster decides when this factor will play a role, based on the pod biochemistry's similarity to that of transhumans and numerous other factors. Certain augmentations may simply not be available, having not yet been invented for the alien physiology in question. While efforts have been made to provide these pods with their equivalent of basic biomods, the full protections offered by those enhancements may simply not be available. This means that the pod may or may not be vulnerable to such things as disease, aging, lack of sleep, long-term exposure to microgravity, shock from injuries, allergies, or other biological problems that transhumanity has attempted to eradicate. Likewise, the pod might not be able to heal quickly or regenerate limbs. It is also possible that the pod may be burdened with unusual biological problems inherent to its species, such as bizarre gastrointestinal issues, hacking up hairballs, respiratory distress, or an alien version of leukemia. Gamemasters are encouraged to be inventive. Morphs with alien biochemistry count as exotic and inflict -30 modifiers to Alienation and Integrity Tests (p. 272, EP). This trait is only available to pods created from alien life.",,FALSE,TRUE,,,FALSE,
Allies,30,"The character is part of or has a relationship with some influential group that they can occasionally call on for support. For example, this could be their old gatecrashing crew, former research lab co-workers, a criminal cartel they are part of, or an elite social clique. The gamemaster and player should work out what the characters relationship is with this group, and why the character can call on them for aid. Gamemasters should take care that these allies are not abused, such as calling on them more than once per game session. The characters ties to this group are also a two-way streetthey will be expected to perform duties for the group on occasion as well (a potential plot seed for scenarios).",,TRUE,FALSE,,,FALSE,
Ambidextrous,10,"The character can use and manipulate objects equally well with both hands (they do not suffer the off-hand modifier). If the character has other prehensile limbs (feet, tail, tentacles, etc), this trait may be applied to a limb other than the hand. This trait may be taken multiple times for multiple limbs.",,TRUE,FALSE,,,FALSE,
Animal Empathy,5,The character has an instinctive feel for handling and working with non-sapient animals of all kinds. Apply a +10 modifier to Animal Handling skill tests or whenever the character makes a test to influence or interact with an animal.,,TRUE,FALSE,,,FALSE,
Anomalous Mind,-20,"Found almost exclusively in AGIs, uplifts, and the subjects of highly experimental pyschosurgical proce- dures, your mental patterns are dramatically outside the norm of transhumanity. The uniqueness of their mental map makes psychosurgery, routine backup, and resleeving difficult and risky. Any attempts to perform psychosurgery on the character suffer a -10 penalty and automatically cause 1 SV in addition to any other results and regardless of the success or failure of a procedure. Also, backing up and resleeving are not automatic (pp. 268-271, EP) and require active management of the process. Any technician operating the ego bridge during such procedures must succeed on a Psychosurgery Test or the backup/ sleeving attempt will fail.","-10 when receiving psychosurgery, 1SV",TRUE,FALSE,,,FALSE,
Async Familiarity,5,"This character has a keen sense for the subtle behavioral clues and micro-expressions that many asyncs unconsciously adopt after their infection. As a result, they may make a Kinesics Test to identify an async as such on their behavior alone. Gamemasters are encouraged to make this test difficult (-30) at best, given that there is usually no outward sign of Watts-MacLeod infection or the use of psi sleights. This trait is most common among asyncs, but it may be allowed for characters that have studied asyncs or spent significant time in their presence.",,TRUE,FALSE,,,FALSE,
Bad Luck,-30,"Due to some inexplicable cosmic coincidence, things seem to go wrong around the character. The gamemaster is given a pool of Moxie points equal to the character's Moxie stat, which also refreshes at the same rate as the character's Moxie. Only the gamemaster may utilize this Moxie, however, and the purpose is to use it against the character. In other words, the gamemaster can use this bad Moxie to cause the character to automatically fail, flip-flop a roll, and so on. To reflect the black cloud that follows the character, the gamemaster can even use this bad Moxie against the character's friends and allies, when they are doing something with or related to the character, though this should be used sparingly. Gamemasters who might be reluctant to sabotage the character should remember that the player asked for it by purchasing this trait.",,TRUE,FALSE,,,FALSE,
Beta,-20,"This character is a beta fork of their original self, which for some reason is no longer alive (most likely lost during the Fall). They were created some time ago, so they have grown and overcome most of their original aptitude deficiencies. This character may not have a Moxie higher than 1 and no Active skills higher than 60, nor may they possess the Psi trait. They also have only a limited set of their original self's memories-much of their previous life is simply lost to them. They automatically receive the Edited Memories trait (p. 149, EP), without gaining the bonus CP. Beta forks are, of course, illegal in many jurisdictions, and some consider them less than human (the gamemaster may apply a Social Stigma: Beta trait in appropriate circumstances; again no bonus CP are gained).Note: the restrictions of the trait are not implemented; review your character to ascertain that it is properly constrained to the listed requirements. If you acquired this trait through packs or lifepaths, you may subtract the relevant values and reassign their CP.",,TRUE,FALSE,,,FALSE,
Black Mark (Level 1),-10,"At some point in the character's past, they managed to do something that earned a black mark on their reputation. For some reason, no matter what they do, this black mark cannot be shaken off and continues to haunt their interactions. In game terms, the character picks one faction. Every time they interact with this faction (such as a Networking Test) or with an NPC from this faction (Social Skill Tests) who knows who the character is, they suffer a -10 modifier.",,TRUE,FALSE,,,FALSE,
Black Mark (Level 2),-20,"At some point in the character's past, they managed to do something that earned a black mark on their reputation. For some reason, no matter what they do, this black mark cannot be shaken off and continues to haunt their interactions. In game terms, the character picks one faction.

Every time they interact with this faction (such as a Networking Test) or with an NPC from this faction (Social Skill Tests) who knows who the character is, they suffer a -30 modifier.",,TRUE,FALSE,,,FALSE,
Botched Merge,-15,"In the past, the character suffered a serious complication during an attempt to merge a fork that caused irreparable damage to their ego map, leaving them with a weaker grip on their memories and own identity. For some reason-perhaps due to irreproducible memories or information that would otherwise be lost, moral conviction, or the lack of any prior backup states to re-instance-the decision was made to carry on with a damaged mind. Now, high-stress situations can cause periods of disso- ciation, amnesia, and body alienation. Whenever the character takes stress damage, they must succeed on an INT x 3 Test or immediately enter a dissociative state where they feel disconnected from their body, lose some awareness of the events around them, and/ or forget certain information, memories, or skills. In this state they suffer a -10 penalty on all tests. The dissociative state persists for one minute or for the duration of a derangement if one is acquired due to trauma.",,TRUE,FALSE,,,FALSE,
Botched Uplift,-30,"(Uplifts Only) This trait is only available to uplifts. Although possessed of a rough self-awareness and the trap- pings of sapience, your mental development is flawed. Despite the best efforts of your creators and teachers, you cannot ever fully overcome your mental limitations and serious social awkwardness. Even psychosurgery is unlikely to fix you. You have an aptitude maximum of 10 for both COG or SAV. You have difficulty keeping up with others in complex social situations and are likely highly reliant on your muse to organize your life and coach you through your daily affairs. Whoever does interact with you likely treats you with either contempt or pity, as your difficulties are apparent to anyone who has more than the briefest exchanges with you.",,TRUE,FALSE,,,FALSE,
Brave,10,"This character does not scare easily, and will face threats, intimidation, and certain bodily harm without flinching. As a side effect, the character is not always the best at gauging risks, especially when it comes to factoring in danger to others. The character receives a +10 modifier on all tests to resist fear or intimidation.",+10 against intimidation,TRUE,FALSE,,,FALSE,
Civilian Analyst (Level 1),10,"The character is a civilian analyst in a large intelligence agency such as the Titanian Ministry of State's Civilian Intelligence Directorate or the Planetary Consortium's Oversight.  For each level, the character receives a +10 on all Networking Tests within their agency. The character is actively employed there and is expected to put in at least 6 hours of work four days a week (if Titanian) or 8 hours a day five days a week (if Jovian, Venusian, Lunar, or Martian). In some polities, the character may be able to work remotely. This trait may be a poor choice for Jovian characters, as most Jovian intel analysts are confined to the Castle, with very limited freedom of movement. Also note that characters making frequent requests for secret information not related to their job functions will draw scrutiny.",+10 Networking with employer,TRUE,FALSE,,,FALSE,
Civilian Analyst (Level 2),20,"The character is a manager coordinating the work of 3-5 other analysts and a few dozen AIs, or a senior non-manager. For each level, the character receives a +10 on all Networking Tests within their agency. The character is actively employed there and is expected to put in at least 6 hours of work four days a week (if Titanian) or 8 hours a day five days a week (if Jovian, Venusian, Lunar, or Martian).

Combat Paralysis,-20,"The character has an unfortunate habit of freezing in combat or stressful situations, like a deer caught in headlights. Anytime violence breaks out around the character, or they are surprised, the character must make a Willpower Test in order to act or respond in any way. If they fail the test, they lose their action and simply stand there, remaining incapable of reacting to the situation.",,TRUE,FALSE,,,FALSE,
Common Sense,10,"The character has an innate sense of judgment that cuts through other distractions and factors that might cloud a decision. Once per game session, the player may ask the gamemaster what choice they should make or what course of action they should take, and the gamemaster should give them solid advice based on what the character knows. Alternately, if the character is about to make a disastrous decision, the gamemaster can use the characters free hint and warn the player they are making a mistake.",,TRUE,FALSE,,,FALSE,
Coronal Adaptation,30,"For biomorphs, this radical alteration enables the subject's metabolism to live off solar energy, using medichines to repair radiation damage. This same metabolism also generates powerful electromagnetic fields that protect the character from the intense temperatures and radiation in the coronal environment and even enable the character to sail the solar winds. Morphs with this adaptation cannot survive outside the coronal environment (or similar environments) for more than a few days without extensive medical support. Coronal adaptation can only be applied to morphs that also have medichines (p. 308, EP).  For synthmorphs, this adaptation restructures the morph's composition with heat-resistant materials capable of surviving superheated plasma and shielded against radiation. The shell is also equipped with refractive metamaterials and a perfectly mirrored surface, giving it an albedo of nearly one. The reflective surface protects the wearer from well over 99% of the radiant energy that falls upon it, but a powerful cooling system and extensive radiation shielding are required for the minuscule percentage of energy that slips through. Generated electromagnetic fields also protect the morph and enable propulsion along solar magnetic lines. This adaptation provides a +10 modifier to the biomorph's Free Fall skill tests in the presence of strong electromagnetic fields. It also provides 10 points of Energy armor against heat and electromagnetic-based attacks (such as lasers, microwaves, and plasma weapons, but not explosions).",,FALSE,TRUE,,,FALSE,
Curbed Intelligence,-10,"(AGIs Only) Fearful of AGIs that might develop into seed AIs like the TITANs, some developers have programmed extra safeguards and precautions into AGI mind- states to limit their intelligence.

Danger Sense,10,The character has an intuitive sixth sense that warns them of imminent threats. They receive a +10 modifier on Surprise Tests.,+10 to surprise tests,TRUE,FALSE,,,FALSE,
Data Footprint,-10,"The character is particularly sloppy about keeping a lid on their daily living, online, and social networking interactions, leaving a larger data footprint than usual in the public eye. Apply a +10 modifier to any Research Tests to gather information on the character or track them online (see Scanning, Tracking, and Monitoring, p. 251, EP) and any Networking Tests to ascertain the character's networking interactions (see Keeping It Quiet, p. 288, EP).",+10 to opposing research tests,TRUE,FALSE,,,FALSE,
Debt (Level 1),-10,"The character is in debt to a loan shark or powerful organization that demands regular payments. The debt may be the result of a legitimate loan or the character may be a victim of extortion. Either way, the character is expected to pay, with an interest rate that is far above standard (and possibly illegal), and the creditor organization will not take no for an answer. The approximate level of debt is equal to the following amount: Level 1: 20,000 credits (plus 1d10 x 500 credits in weekly interest; Level 2: 40,000 credits (plus 2d10 x 500 credits in weekly interest; Level 3: 60,000 credits (plus 3d10 x 500 credits in weekly interest. Each week the character is expected to make a payment on the debt equal to the weekly interest. Failure to do so will cause the creditor organization to retaliate, which can take any number of forms. Hypercorp creditors may lower the character's rep by publicly declaring them a deadbeat while criminal syndicates may send ego hunters to extract full payment. Many organizations employ debt collectors that know how to get money from reluctant debtors one way or the other. If the character completely reneges on this debt, they gain the Black Mark (Level 2) and Enemy traits. Characters may be given the option of working off their weekly interest payment-or even their entire debt-by performing a job or other favor for the creditor organization. Generally, this will be a high risk mission for which the organization does not want to use its own personnel, such as retrieval of data from an exsurgent-infested abandoned habitat or assassinating the head of a Martian crime syndicate.

Additionally, they must make a WIL x 3 Test to avoid responding to acts of intimidation with threat displays or violence, though such violence need not be lethal (note that they will still back down if someone successfully uses Intimidation skill on them). Since the evolutionary purpose of dominance structures is to minimize conflict, domineering uplifts prefer to surround themselves with submissives and will avoid entering situations where they know their dominance might be challenged.

Enlarged Size,10,"This trait increases the size of an existing morph model from either small to medium or medium to large (morphs may only be enlarged once). Morphs enlarged to a medium size lose the effects of the Small Size trait (p. 95) and gain 5 points of Durability. Morphs enlarged to a large size gain the effects of the Large Size trait (p. 94) and 10 points of Durability. Durability increases also effect Wound Threshold and Death Rating as normal. Enlarging a morph may affect other changes at the gamemaster's discretion. For example, morphs that relied on their small size for flight may lose that capability or suffer modifiers.",,FALSE,TRUE,,,FALSE,
Entrepreneur (Level 1),10,"This character is the owner or co-owner of their own small hypercorp, microcorp, or business franchise-or an active participant in an autonomist cooperative, collective, or work syndicate.

Errant Fork,-10,"Whether through conscious action or a freak occurrence, you are not the only you out there. An alpha fork of yourself exists and has decided to pursue its own path. Though this fork is not necessarily an enemy, it does have its own agenda and interests that sometimes run counter to your own. There may be legal issues involved, such as competing claims over who is the original alpha and therefore has rights to any property (or in some jurisdictions, the right to exist). There may be social awkwardness, as the division between you and your alpha forced you to compete over your friends, family, or even lovers. Though the alpha fork began with the same aptitudes, skills, traits, rep, and so on as yourself, it has diverged and begun to develop as a separate character, controlled by the gamemaster. Other complications in the relationship between these alphas should exist, enough that the other alpha should serve as an occasional hindrance or surprise. The alphas may, for example, have a strong rivalry going over their shared field of expertise or may simply feel a need to prove themselves better than the other.",,TRUE,FALSE,,,FALSE,
Established Fork,5,"The character begins the game with a fully instanced fork of themselves, and the player can specify if it is an alpha, beta, or delta fork; beta and delta forks will have their stats adjusted according to the rules outlined on pp. 273-274, EP. Psychosurgical alterations that differentiate the fork from the char- acter such as personality edits, mannerisms, and gender/sexual identity (but not traits) can be defined by the player and incorporated into the fork at no cost. Any other positive or negative mental traits taken for the fork must be purchased and applied to the fork exclusively. The fork's morph and gear must be paid for and provided by expenditure of the char- acter's own CP and starting credits. This trait ensures the fork is established and recognized as legal in whatever habitat the character lives in when the game starts, but there is no guarantee that the fork would be recognized as legal elsewhere or that the legality will remain current once the game is underway. This trait can be taken more than once. Players should carefully coordinate with their gamemaster to ensure a common understanding of the fork's place in the game and how they can be utilized.",,TRUE,FALSE,,,FALSE,
Fast Learner,10,The character improves skills and learns new ones in half the time it normally takes.,,TRUE,FALSE,,,FALSE,
Fast Metabolism,-5,"The morph's metabolism runs hot, requiring the character to eat two to three times as much food as a normal character with similar body mass. Food tends to be plentiful and cheap in most transhuman settlements, but this trait can pose a problem in remote areas or when visiting settlements with limited resources. The character must plan ahead and pack enough food on expeditions. If the character is eating off their rep, they must expend two trivial favors each day for the additional food they require. If the character is unable to obtain enough food, they lose SOM at the rate of one point per day until they resume their usual caloric intake.

Faulty Education,-10,"Not everyone receives the same quality of education and many are taught incorrect things. Some children, for example, are raised with an ideologically driven system that prizes obedience over truth and accuracy-something still common in certain Jovian, brinker, and religious communities. Others, like many infugees, isolates, and zeroed indentures, only haveaccess to substandard or obsolete reference material. No matter the cause, the character thinks they know far more than they really do. Once per session, the gamemaster may intentionally mislead the character when giving them the results of a Knowledge Skill Test or otherwise detailing some aspect of the setting or a social interaction, depending on the character's background. This misinformation represents the char-cter's faulty understanding of the topic at hand and should be roleplayed appropriately, even if the player knows that their character is mistaken.",,TRUE,FALSE,,,FALSE,
First Impression,10,The character has a way of charming or otherwise making a good impression the first time they interact with someone.

They are immune to stress from this source. This trait may be taken more than once, for hardening to different experiences. Each time it is taken, the character's maximum Moxie score is reduced by 1. Characters may not become hardened to the merging of forks. Characters that become hardened through repeat exposure (p. 214, EP) gain this trait for free.",,TRUE,FALSE,,,FALSE,
Heightened Instinct,10,"(Uplifts Only) This trait is only available to uplifts. Though the character is fully sapient and normally socialized, the uplift process left much of their unconscious instinct intact, and they are able to synthesize a great deal of contextual information instinctively. This provides a marked advantage when dealing with confusing or tense situations, as the character's subconscious drives their actions and responses faster than conscious decision-making. The character receives a +1 bonus to Initiative and ignores up to -10 of any modifiers for distraction when making skill tests.",,TRUE,FALSE,,,FALSE,
High-Temperature Operation,10,"This morph has been designed to operate only in high-temperature environments, enabling them to withstand temperatures up to 1,000 C. This morph loses 1 point of COO for every 5 minutes it spends at temperatures lower than 250 C, and 1 point of COO for every minute that it spends below 150 C. When its COO equals zero the morph becomes completely immobile. This same penalty is applied to all COO-based skill rolls. The morph's cyberbrain and mesh access still work in these circumstances, but the morph cannot physically move under its own power. Even if placed back in higher temperatures, if it was previously reduced to total immobility, the morph halves its COO and SOM (round down) until it has been serviced. This trait may only be applied to synthmorphs.

Hoarder,-10,"With the limitations on living space and need for resource management in all but the wealthiest habs, most transhumans are used to living with a minimal number of personal possessions. The flexibility and multi-purpose nature of most objects and availability of information, entertainment, and communication over digital or VR services all allow this to work well, but hoarders have a psychological compul- sion to keep things that they don't need and serve no purpose. Particularly common among corvid uplifts and some Fall survivors that lost everything, characters with this trait have a hard time giving away or disposing of things. Unless their behavior is somehow managed, they will accumulate over- whelming collections of junk. Each day, the character must make a WIL x 3 Test to keep their compulsion under control. If they fail, they will keep any objects they would normally throw away or recycle (food packaging, drink bulbs, broken or useless objects like dead ectos, ammunition clips, and the like) and must acquire one new item that day; all of those items will be added to their hoard. Hoarders can force themselves to ignore this compulsion for a day by taking one point of stress damage.

Identifiable Quirk,-10,"Transhumans may be able to switch bodies and travel the entire solar system to start a new life, but some things can't be left behind. The character has a unique behavioral quirk that makes identification easy, no matter the morph in which they are sleeved. Attempts to identify this character through Kinesics or similar skills gain a +10 bonus. This quirk could be a nervous twitch of the lips, distinct accent, noticeable laugh, or unusual gait.

Identity Crisis,-10,"The character's ego has trouble adapting itself to the changed look of a new morph they are stuck with the mental image of their original body, and simply do not grow accustomed to their new face(s). As a result, the character has difficulty identifying themselves in the mirror, photos, surveillance feeds, etc. They frequently forget the look and shape of their current morph, acting inappropriately, describing themselves by their original body, forgetting to duck when walking through doorways, etc. This is primarily a roleplaying trait, but the gamemaster may apply appropriate modifiers (usually -10) to tests affected by this inability to adapt.",,TRUE,FALSE,,,FALSE,
Illiterate,-10,"The character knows how to speak, but has difficulty reading or writing.

Apply a -30 modifier to any hearing-based Perception Tests. At the gamemaster's discretion, certain medium and high-frequency sounds may be inaudible as they are outside the morph's range. This lack of hearing may be compensated for with audio implants or microphones and mesh inserts.",,TRUE,FALSE,,,FALSE,
Impaired Linguistics (Level 1),-10,"This trait is only available to uplifts. This uplift's particular brain structure has difficulty processing language. At Level 1, the uplift loses some of their ability to speak, read, and comprehend things spoken by others when they suffer from stress. Each time the uplift suffers a trauma, they must make a Language Test at -10 to speak (both verbal and via mesh inserts) or comprehend (reading or listening) anything above the most basic words and information. This test only needs to be made once for each language, but for each additional trauma suffered, the test must be made again, with an additional cumulative -10 modifier. If the uplift loses their language abilities, they will recover them when that particular trauma is healed. In the meantime, they can only convey and understand basic, one-word, one-syllable concepts, such as eat or run.",,TRUE,FALSE,,,FALSE,
Impaired Linguistics (Level 2),-20,"This trait is only available to uplifts. This uplift's particular brain structure has difficulty processing language. The uplift's language centers are permanently hobbled. Their free natural Language skill at character creation is 40 + INT, and no Language skill may be raised above 60. Additionally, they must make make a Language Test to convey or comprehend particularly complex information or sentences at a -10 modifier.

Level 2 does not incorporate Level 1 effects.",,TRUE,FALSE,,,FALSE,
Impared Proprioception,-10,"This trait is only available to octomorphs and flying squid morphs. Baseline cephalopods lack a sense of proprioception in their arms and tentacles, meaning they only know where their limbs are by looking at them. Though a standard proprioceptive sense was added to most octomorph and flying squid models, a number of germlines lack the proper neural structure.

Indenture Holder,30,"The character currently owns the indenture contract of another ego. The person subject to indenture could be anyone from a Fall infugee to a criminal working off the damages of an assault charge. The indenture itself could have been voluntarily arranged with the character, awarded by a court, or the character could have bought it through IndEX (p. 162). The terms and conditions that will end the indenture should be clearly determined as a set credit amount, levels of favors expended, or provision of specific services. It is recommended that the contractual services are reasonably likely to be completed within 6 months. Players and gamemasters should collaborate to estab- lish the relationship the character has with the inden- ture and the exact skills and reputations of the NPC. Gamemasters should be very careful that this trait is not abused, and remember that, as the indenture holder, the character also has some responsibilities to the NPC. Physical harm, mental trauma, and illegal activities could negate the terms of indenture and may have serious repercussions for the character. Should the character treat their indenture well, they could become a trusted ally, but ill treatment could make them into an enemy (p. 149, EP).",,TRUE,FALSE,,,FALSE,
Information Control,10,"This character has a knack for diligence and caution in their daily living, online, and social networking interactions, reducing the amount of extraneous or sensitive information about themselves that leaks out in the public eye.

Innocuous,10,"In an age when exotic appearances and good looks are commonplace, the morph's look is surprisingly bland and undistinguished, in that cookie cutter sort of way. The character's physical looks are so mundane that others have a hard time picking them out of a crowd, describing their appearance, or otherwise remembering physical details. Apply a -10 modifier to all tests made to spot, describe, or remember the character. This modifier does not apply to psi or mesh searches.",,FALSE,TRUE,,,FALSE,
Intense Relationship,-10,"Many characters retain close relationships with family, friends, and lovers. Sometimes, however, the interpersonal connection in these relationships becomes so intense as to be a detriment. The character is emotionally dependent on their relationship with a particular NPC to the point that being separated from the NPC is taxing. Each week the character goes without mean- ingful communication with the NPC, they suffer 1 point of stress. If cut off for more than two weeks, they also suffer a -10 modifier to all Task Actions until they are able to reconnect, as they are too distracted to focus. The character also suffers double the stress from witnessing the NPC being hurt or killed. Basic operational security dictates that the character cannot tell the NPC anything about Firewall nor can they communicate with the NPC during a Firewall mission. Characters breaking these rules put the lives of their friends and family at risk. Gamemasters should have enemies of Firewall use friends and family against characters who break these rules.",,TRUE,FALSE,,,FALSE,
Intuitive Cracker (Level 1),10,"When it comes to brute-force hacking, this character has an intuitive sense for finding and deploying the right exploit tool for the job.

Killer Instinct,15,"(Uplifts Only) This trait is only available to uplifts, and is most common in those from octopus or orca genestock. During uplift the most predatory aspect of the char- acter's psyche was left largely intact, and this has left them comfortable with bloodletting.

Lacks Manipulators,-10,"This morph lacks hands or other limbs with a fine manipulation capability. It is a common trait with quadrupeds (as well as certain smart animals). A morph with this trait may not be able to manipulate objects at all or may only be able to do so with a very limited capacity. Some morphs can hold small-sized or smaller tools, weapons, and other objects between their paws or in their mouths, for example, but unless these items have been specifically designed to operate with this morphology, the character will suffer a -30 modifier to use or may not be able to use them at all (gamemaster discretion). Objects that don't require physical manipulation, such as tools controlled by wireless commands, may be used normally.

Large Size,0,"The morph is significantly larger than a normal transhuman, which has its advantages and disadvantages. The character counts as a large target in combat, granting all enemies a +10 bonus on attack rolls against the character. Their mass works against them; double the damage from falling or collisions after armor is applied. The character gains the reach advantage (p. 204, EP) against standard-size targets (double this against small targets) and can also wield two-handed weapons in one hand without penalty. At the gamemaster's discretion, the character may suffer a -20 modifier when handling small items, assuming they come equipped with no fine manipulators. Naturally, they may also have difficulty with armor, clothing, and other gear manufactured for smaller morphs, as well as the cramped confines of many habitats. This trait applies to morphs that are inherently large. To apply it to existing morphs with a smaller baseline, use the Enlarged Size trait (p. 83). The following existing morphs are considered to have the Large Size trait: fenrir, neo-beluga, neo-orca, q-morph, sundiver. The following existing bots and vehicles are also considered large: dwarf, flux car, flying car, ground car, hyperdense exoskeleton, Mars buggy, portable plane, rocket buggy, skimmer.",,FALSE,TRUE,,,FALSE,
Lemon,-10,"This trait is only available for synthetic morphs. This particular morph has some unfixable flaws. Once per game session (preferably at a time that will maximize drama or hilarity), the gamemaster can call for the character to make a MOX x 10 Test (using their current Moxie score).

Lost Fork,-5,"A fork of the character has gone missing without a trace. The fork was legal and in compliance with all relevant laws and standards-then it vanished. The version that disappeared was an alpha fork, a complete recent copy of the character's ego that possesses sensi- tive knowledge about all aspects of the character's life. Players and gamemasters should discuss this trait before using it in their game and address the following questions: When did the disappearance occur? Why was the fork created? What was the fork doing just before the disappearance? What leads, if any, does the player possess at the start of the game? This trait is often taken in combination with the Edited Memories, Enemy, and/or On the Run traits.",,TRUE,FALSE,,,FALSE,
Low Gravity Adaptation,-10,"The morph is adapted to live in low gravity (0.15 g or less) and struggles in higher-gravity environments. Treat the character as suffering the effects of high gravity (p. 199, EP) for every full 0.2 g over 0.15. For example, while the character would operate fine on Luna or Titan, on Mars or Mercury (both 0.38 g) the character would be treated as if suffering the effects of 1 wound. On Venus (0.9 g), the character would be treated as if suffering the effects of 3 wounds. For each of these high gravity increments, also reduce the character's Walking Rate by 1 and their Running Rate by 4. While even low-gravityadapted bodies can sustain the stress of high gravity (over 1 g) for temporary periods, the gamemaster may rule that long-term exposure to higher gravity may result in the accumulation of actual wounds, not just wound effects.

Memory Artifact,-5,"This particular morph has an anomalous neural structure. As a result, sometimes not all aspects of an ego are properly erased after it has been uploaded and the mind is customarily wiped. This morph has memories from a previous ego that continue to resurface. Once per week, the ego sleeved in the morph must make a MOX x 10 Test. If it fails, certain memories will manifest in the current occupant's mind. This memories are likely to be from emotionally charged or otherwise memorable events in a previous ego's life. The first time the latent memories activate, the ego suffers (1d10 / 2) SV. Additional incidents of memory recall may or may not inflict stress, depending on the memory in question (traumatic ones certainly will), how drastically the memories conflict with the character's personality, and whether or not the character is aware of the source of these memories. The character naturally integrates these memories in with their own, making them a long-term or possibly permanent change that can only be removed with psychotherapy. These memories may of course be useful for plot purposes, as they may include sensitive data, secrets hidden from the public, or information the previous ego does not want spread.

Military Intelligence,10,"This trait may only be taken by characters with the Military Rank trait (below). Since all members of JSFI are commissioned officers, Jovian characters must have Military Rank of at least Level 2. The character is posted to their military's intelligence service. This makes it possible for the character to use reputation to garner classified information at one Favor level lower than normal, but it also immerses the character in the spook world, limiting their movements and greatly complicating their collaboration with Firewall.

The strength of this emotion may ebb and wane, but it is omnipresent enough to have a consistent impact on the character's mood and personality. This imposed emotion does not affect the character's abilities, but it should be taken into effect for roleplaying purposes. The emotion may be quelled with endocrine control implants (but not emotional dampers) or temporarily overcome via a Psychosurgery Test (for biomorphs) or Hardware: Robotics Test (for synthmorphs). Specific drugs may also reduce the effect, based on the particular aptitude affected. Despite these efforts, the emotion will return in 1d10 days.",,FALSE,TRUE,,,FALSE,
No Cortical Stack,-15,"The morph lacks the cortical stack that is common to morphs of its type.

Additionally the character suffers a -10 modifier to Stress Tests involving emotions, fear, or pain. At the gamemaster's discretion, certain intense emotions or rushes may temporarily overwhelm the character; if they fail a WIL x 3 Test, they are disoriented and must spend a Complex Action to regain their wits.

Patron,30,"The character has an influential person in their life who can be relied on for occasional support. This could be a wealthy hyperelite family member, a high-ranking triad boss, or an anarchist networker with an unbeatable reputation. When called upon, this patron can pull strings on the characters behalf, supply resources, introduce them to people they need to know, and bail them out of trouble. The player and gamemaster should work together to define exactly who this NPC is and what their relationship with the player character is. Specifically, the question of why this patron is supporting the character should be answered (familial obligation? childhood buddies? the character saved their life once?). Gamemasters should be careful that this trait does not get abused. The patron should be an occasional help (probably no more than once per game session at most) but is not always at the characters beck-and-call. If the character asks for too much, too often, they should find the patrons support drying up. Additionally, the character may need to take action to maintain the relationship, such as undertaking a mission on the patrons behalf.

Personal Connection,15,"The character has some sort of personal connection that often allows them to get one particular category of goods or services at a discount in most major habitats. Perhaps an old friend owns a body bank corp, their family is in the shipping business, they won a lifetime membership discount for a common retail chain, or someone in a criminal cartel owes them a life-long obligation. The player chooses one particular type of goods or services, such as morphs, cargo shipping, weapons, robots, software, implants, and so on. The character can usually acquire these goods or services at one cost category cheaper. This does not apply to Expensive goods. The player may use this trait as often as they wish, but the gamemaster may rule that is simply not available in certain settlements-their connection may not have a presence there or may be too strained for resources to offer the discount. Also at the gamemaster's discre- tion, if the character takes actions that would substan- tially compromise the relationship that enables this discount, they may be temporarily unable to use this trait or may even lose it for good. This trait does not reduce the cost of goods and services acquired during character creation, nor may it be taken in conjunction with the Tenure trait.",,TRUE,FALSE,,,FALSE,
Phobia Disorder,-10,"Phobias are a minor type of mental anxiety disorder based on an irrational fear of a particular situation or thing. Phobic characters will go to great lengths to avoid their particular fear-they must make a WIL x 3 Test to even stay within proximity, otherwise they will flee the area. If forced into close proximity with their fear, they will suffer 1 SV per hour and take a -10 modifier to all of their actions. If they are trapped in close proximity to the source of their fear, they will suffer (1d10 / 2) SV per hour and take a -30 modifier to all actions. Luckily, phobias are easier to treat than other disorders. The base timeframe for psychotherapy treatment of a phobia is 20 hours. Phobia disorders may be inflicted on characters that suffer too many traumas in place of other mental disorders. Gamemasters should keep in mind, however, that phobias are easier to treat; though the possibility of taking more mental stress from the phobia may offset this. At the gamemaster's discre- tion, temporary phobias can be used as derange- ments inflicted with mental trauma (p. 209, EP). In these situations, the phobia should be linked to the particular source of trauma. For example, a character who suffers a trauma from remembering their death after vacuum exposure might pick up a derangement phobia of vacuum environments.",,TRUE,FALSE,,,FALSE,

Planned Obsolescence,-5,"The morph is a hypercorp model that requires periodic GSP (Genetic Service Pack) therapy. For every three months of game time, the character must spend credits equal to 10% the cost of the morph on GSP upgrades. If they fail to do so, the morph's SOM is reduced by 5 until the character gets their GSP therapy. These penalties are cumulative over time (at 6 months, 9 months, etc.), but getting GSP therapy once removes all penalties. The character suffers no SOM loss if the majority of a given 3 month period was spent in hibernation, in a healing vat, or in some other form of metabolic suspension. The SOM reduction is due to low level neural degradation, minor tumors, joint pain, and other problems that crop up and express later as hypercorp genetic designers working on tight budgets and tighter deadlines race to release morph models with extra value-added features. While theoretically over many years this trait would lead to the early death of the morph, in game terms the morph stops accruing penalties when its SOM is reduced to 5. The character regains their normal SOM score if they resleeve. This trait is only available to biomorphs (including uplifts and pods).",,FALSE,TRUE,,,FALSE,

Discuss with your gamemaster to detail what your character did to gain the respect of this other group. This trait does not guarantee safety or cooperation between you and members of the chosen organization, only some additional consideration between professionals.

Real World Naievite,-10,"Due to their background, the character has very limited personal experience with the real (physical) worldor they have spent so much time in simulspace that their functioning in real life is impaired. They lack an understanding of many physical properties, social cues, and other factors that people with standard human upbringings take for granted. This lack of common sense may lead the character to misunderstand how a device works or to misinterpret someones body language. Once per game session, the gamemaster may intentionally mislead the character when giving them a description about some thing or some social interaction. This falsehood represents the characters misunderstanding of the situation, and should be roleplayed appropriately, even if the player realizes the characters mistake.

Reduced Size,-10,This trait reduces the size of an existing morph model from either large to medium or medium to small (morphs may only be reduced once). Morphs shrunk to a medium size lose the effects of the Large Size trait (next page) and 10 points of Durability. Morphs reduced to a small size gain the effects of the Small Size trait (p. 95) and lose 5 points of Durability. Durability reductions also effect Wound Threshold and Death Rating per normal.

The allergen may be common (dust, dander, plant pollen, certain foods, latex) or uncommon (certain drugs, insect stings). The player and gamemaster should agree on an allergen that fits the game. If exposed to the allergen, the character breaks into hives, has difficulty to breathing (-30 modifier to all actions), and must make a DUR Test or go into anaphylactic shock (dying of respiratory failure in 2d10 minutes unless medical care is applied).

Spacecraft,30,"Buying a personal spacecraft is far beyond the means of most characters. This trait, however, puts a spacecraft in the character's hands, with certain conditions. This trait may only be taken with game master approval and it is best only considered for campaigns where regular space travel is likely to be a major element. Somehow, the character is responsible for a bulk carrier, GEV, LLOTV, scum barge, SLOTV, or standard transport. How and why this occurred- and what strings are attached-should be worked out between the player and gamemaster. The character could be an employed pilot or captain, placed in charge of a hypercorp-owned vessel. Perhaps they are borrowing a ship belonging to a criminal cartel, hyperelite dynasty, or anarchist collective. Maybe they built the ship on their own, but placed themselves permanently in the debt of an esoteric brinker group or smuggling crew to get the materials they needed. The ship may even be stolen, with a bounty out for its recapture. Whatever the circumstances, the character should occasionally be obligated to meet or avoid the needs and demands of the ships' rightful owners, its passengers, and its crew. For example, the character may have salvaged a derelict vessel and converted it into a refugee barge during the Fall, but must now deal with the scum squatters that have effectively taken it over. Operating a ship also comes with a host of logistical issues, from acquiring reaction mass to making deals for passengers and cargo to somehow funding an inexhaustible list of critical repairs.

The character is actively employed there and is expected to put in at least 6 hours of work four days a week (if Titanian) or 8 hours a day five days a week (if Jovian, Venusian, Lunar, or Martian). Players taking this trait must seek gamemaster permission and develop a plausible story for how their character is able to participate in Firewall missions while working for the agency.

This means the character could be a secret spy, courier, or saboteur, possibly even regularly engaging in behavior of which they are completely unaware. Alternatively, they could simply be an enemy's secret ace in the hole, a trump card to exploit when the time is right.
