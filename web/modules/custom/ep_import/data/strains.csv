Haunting,"This strain is the most insidious of the exsurgent viruses. Over time, it rewrites the target’s personality and motivations, slowly but surely subverting and taking control of the victim’s mind. At rst the character is unlikely to even be aware of the infection, and as it progresses the changes the virus makes to the target will at rst seem natural, as if some new aspect of their personality was simply manifesting itself. As the effects grow more pronounced, however, the victim becomes aware that they are being methodically altered but is in most cases unable to act against it. In the end, they are completely transformed into a pawn of the ETI. Their mind is no longer transhuman, but alien.",,,"EP.366,XR.47"
Mindstealer,"Very similar to the haunting virus, the mindstealer strain is much quicker acting. Instead of slowly subverting the target’s mind over the course of months, the mindstealer virus rapidly recodes the victim’s brain in a matter of minutes. This infection is much more invasive and brute-force, often causing significant side effects to the target’s mental state as a result. This strain is only spread as a digital virus, nanoplague, or basilisk hack (not as a biological nanovirus).

Once the victim is infected, it takes the virus a number of Action Turns equal to COG + INT + SAV to completely take over their mind (20 Action Turns = 1 minute). During this time, the target is actively aware that their mind is under attack and undergoing massive changes against their will. This process is confusing, frightening, and painful, inflicting a –30 modier to all of the character’s actions for the duration. Many victims are reduced to whimpering, drooling, or convulsing for the duration. 

This mental transformation inflicts 2d10 mental stress to the target. Once complete, the victim is an exsurgent NPC, under the gamemaster’s control.",,,"EP.366,XR.47"
Watts-MacLeod,"The Watts-MacLeod strain is a strangely benevolent version of the exsurgent virus, seeming to imbue its victims with psi abilities without any of the other transformative elements typical of other strains. Perhaps created as an accidental mutation of the exsurgent virus, there are many who wonder if the true detrimental effects of this strain simply have yet to reveal themselves.

Though infection with this strain does provide some bene ts to the character, the gamemaster should make sure to play up the creepy and unsettling nature of this virus. The character should never be certain that they haven’t in fact been subtly influenced by the virus in ways they can’t immediately pinpoint—they should always feel like the axe may fall at any moment. ",,Transmission vectors for the Watts-MacLeod strain are unclear; treat with extreme caution.,"EP.367,XR.48"
Xenomorph,"The xenomorph strain transforms the target’s body in addition to their mind. It is only spread as a biological nanovirus or nanoplague (not as a digital virus or basilisk hack). Over time, the victim’s morph physically transmogri es into some sort of alien life form. Different variants of this strain produce different xenomorphs. It is not known where these different alien templates originated, meaning they may be copies of (once) existing alien species or simply neogenetic creatures created from scratch. The one trait they have in common is that they are universally dangerous. Some speculation in Firewall circles suggests that the exsurgent virus may in fact have a “library” of creature types to deploy, under the assumption that at least some will be more effective than others for exterminating whatever victim species they are fielded against.

This strain follows the same rules as the haunting virus (above), but with the following changes. The timeframe is typically much quicker.","Biological Pathogen, Nanoplague",,EP.367
Babel,"Though babel normally spreads as an aural basilisk hack, it is sometimes transmitted via bionanobots or the digital exsurgent virus. This virus infects muses and some other limited AIs as well as egos.","Basilisk Hack, Biological Pathogen, Digital Virus",Infected victims are infectious to others in stages 2 and 3 via aural basilisk hack. This strain targets the language center of the mind. ,XR.47
Brancusi,"This strain transforms its victims into exsurgent infrastructure, immobilizing and transforming them into sculptures and machines meant for a larger TITAN project. The victim’s mind remains intact throughout the transformation until it is rewritten as a complete exsurgent. It is irreversible, but another character can remove the cortical stack of a victim in the first 10 minutes of the transformation. After that, the stack is merged with the rest of the machinery and can no longer be targeted. ",Nanoplague,"Infected victims are not infectious, though they may produce brancusi nanoswarms upon becoming exsurgents.",XR.47
Chrynalus,"The chrynalus strain follows the common exsurgent pathology of digital intrusion, fabber subversion, and nanoplague production. It’s packaged with an aural basilisk hack to incapacitate transhumans until they are completely infected by the nanoplague. Biological and synthetic victims alike host chrysacid parasites: polyps of crustacean-like limbs that burst from the skin/shell and puppet the exsurgent like a marionette.","Basilisk Hack, Digital Virus, Nanoplague",Infected victims/exsurgents may sometimes exude bits of nanoplague. Wounds inflicted by chrysacids transmit the nanoplague.,CON
Glory,"Glory is initially spread as an AOK basilisk hack that creates a deep-seated obsession to create an advanced nanohive. The first person to become infected by Glory nanobots becomes the “Mother” and immediately seeks to infect a mate. The initial carrier’s infection is transmitted via blood, saliva, or other bodily uids. Once these nanobots enter another person’s bloodstream, they also become infected. 
Glory nanobot infection induces numerous psychological and physiological changes in the subject, eventually transforming them into a specific type of exsurgent life form known as immolators. Immolators are further divided into two sub-types: breeders and drones.

Immolator exsurgents are based on a parasitic alien life form with a distinct life cycle. This parasite infects a target population, establishes a nest within this host population, and then slowly consumes its host both by infection (creating other exsurgents) and anthropophagy (cannibalism). When the host population has been converted or devoured, the breeder immolators enter the breeding phase of their life cycle. In this stage, the male exsurgents inseminate their female partners. These females then incubate their developing zygotes in the immolator colony’s manywombed Mother (using a retractable ovipositor). The Mother typically swells and bloats during this period, consuming the other immolators and filling herself with billions of embryos in the form of nanocrystalline spores. 

Once a critical mass of embryos reach maturity, the Mother and her colony sacrifice themselves and distribute these alien seeds within a new target host population. This is typically accomplished when the Mother self-immolates within a targeted area; the nanocrystal seeds are hardy enough to survive the re and small and light enough to be distributed by winds over a wide area, where they will then hatch into nanobot swarms to infect new subjects. If necessary, more manual measures can be taken, such as physically blowing up the Mother or even cutting the Mother into little pieces (each containing nanocrystal seeds) that are hand-delivered by suicidal immolators across a targeted area (such as a habitat). ","Basilisk Hack, Nanoplague",Biomorphs can transfer it via exchange of bodily fluids.,
Moabite,"The Moabite strain functions exactly like the haunting virus (p. 366, EP), except that the character of the hallucinations and altered mental states experienced by the victims is explicitly religious. The infected are visited by angelic messengers inciting them to action, perceive non-believers as twisted hobgoblins and enemies as demons, and generally experience the world around them as being full of portents from God. Far from being typical cult charlatans, infected characters are imparted with genuine belief by the virus, making them particularly dangerous.","Biological Pathogen, Digital Virus, Nanoplague",Biomorphs infected with the biological pathogen can transfer it via exchange of bodily fluids.,
Skrik,"The skrik strain is a variant of the mindstealer virus (p. 367, EP) that over time enforces an internal physical change.",Biological Pathogen,Biomorphs may be infected by ingesting any part of a skrik or skrik-infected character.,MYE
Stockholm,"The stockholm virus is a variant of the xenomorph virus (p. 368, EP) that transforms the mind of the victim before it transforms their body. Stockholm characters view xenomorphs as beautiful and perfect beings and wish to aspire to become them. They become willing allies of xenomorph exsurgents, aiding and concealing them as long as possible. Other exsurgents will not kill stockholm-infected characters but they will ignore or abuse them. Groups of stockholm-infected exsurgents sometimes form cults that seek to create as many xenomorphs as possible.

The long infection time of this virus creates an insidious mechanism to subvert an entire community. Patient zero gradually spreads the virus in a slow and subtle manner. By the time they reach stage 4, others should be infected with stages 2 and 3, allowing them to hide and protect the xenomorph, aided by their psi sleights and obsessive nature. As more of thecommunity becomes infected, more will reach stage 4 and become full xenomorphs. Eventually the uninfected will realize what is going, but by then, there is a full-blown exsurgent cell, with xenomorph shock troops ready to attack. Stockholm exsurgents will also help xenomorphs fight against transhumans, although they prefer to use indirect methods, like deceiving security forces or compromising life support systems. In heavily infected areas, like Earth or the TITAN Quarantine Zone, a stockholm character is a pitiable scavenger, clinging to life, ignored by the gods they worship, but no less dangerous. They may seek to prey upon the empathy of intruders, pretending to be victims who need help, while trying to infect others or alert other exsurgents. 

This strain of the virus is harder to detect. Apply a −20 modifier to any detection test until the character reaches stage 4 of the infection. ","Biological Pathogen, Nanoplague",Those infected can transfer it via exchange of bodily fluids or prolonged close contact.,XR.47
Vittrad,"The vittrad strain functions like the haunting virus (p. 366, EP), except that the altered perception of the victim acutely emphasizes weaknesses, exploitable  aws, cracks, damaged areas, poor craftsmanship, and similar imperfections in both biological and nonliving things. Upon reaching stage 2 of infection, the infected character acquires the Spot Flaw sleight (p. 180, XR). Additionally, the victim will  nd themself compelled to use these  aws to damage and destroy— particularly when it comes to other life forms. They acquire the Modified Behavior (Compelled: Kill/ Destroy) trait.","Biological Pathogen, Nanoplague","At stage 3, exsurgents can infect others via physical contact.",XR.48
