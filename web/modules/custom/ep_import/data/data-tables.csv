Title,Code,Table,Weight,Description,Speed
Automatic,A,action_type,1,"Automatic actions are “always on” and require no effort from the character, assuming they are conscious.",
Quick,Q,action_type,2,"Quick actions are simple, so they can be done fast and can be multi-tasked. The gamemaster determines how many Quick actions a character may take in a turn.",
Complex,C,action_type,3,Complex actions require concentration or effort. The number of Complex actions a character may take per turn is determined by their Speed stat.,
Task,T,action_type,4,"Task actions are any actions that require longer than one Action Turn to complete. Each Task action has a timeframe, usually listed in the task description or otherwise determined by the gamemaster. The timeframe determines how long the task takes to complete, though this may be reduced by 10 percent for every 10 full points of MoS the character scores on the test (see Margin of Success/Failure, p. 118).",
Blast,,area_effect,1,"Blast weapons include items like grenades, mines, and other explosives that expand outward from a central detonation point. Most blast attacks expand outward in a sphere, though certain shaped charges may direct an explosion in one direction only. The explosive force is stronger near the epicenter and weaker near the outer edges of the sphere. For every meter a target is from the center, reduce the DV of a blast weapon by –2.",
Uniform Blast,,area_effect,2,Uniform blast attacks distribute their power evenly throughout the area of effect. Examples include fuel- air explosives and thermobaric weapons that disperse an explosive mixture in a vapor cloud and ignite it all at once. All targets within the noted blast radius suffer the same damage. Damage against targets outside of the main blast sphere is reduced by –2 DV per meter. ,
Cone,,area_effect,3,"Weapons with a cone effect have an area effect that begins with the tip of the weapon and expands outward in a cone. At short range, this attack effects 1 target; at medium range it affects 2 targets within a meter of each other; and at long or extreme range it affects 3 targets within a meter of the next. Cone-effect attacks do +1d10 damage at short range and –1d10 damage at long and extreme range.",
Variable,,cost_level,0,The cost of this item varies wildly based on conditions. See its description for more details.,
Trivial,,cost_level,1,"1-99 credits, average 50. A meal, a good shirt, or some ammo. As long as it’s appropriate for the location, there’s no trouble finding or fabbing these goods.",
Low,,cost_level,2,"100-499 credits, average 250. Crap insurance, a good meal, a cheap gun or a bare-bones wardrobe, simple safety gear.",
Moderate,,cost_level,3,"500-1,499 credits, average 1,000. A good weapon, a gourmet meal, body armor, renting a morph for a week, an automech or fabber, quality backup insurance. Travel or egocasting within 50,000km. These aren’t out of reach, but add up.",
High,,cost_level,4,"1,500-9,999 credits, average 5,000. Expensive hardware, a beat up pod morph, throwing a rager of a party. Travel or egocasting within 200,000km. ",
Expensive,,cost_level,5,"10,000+ credits, average 20,000. A new morph, military-grade weapons, medical equipment. Transport or egocasting beyond 200,000km. Expensive goods often carry their own minimum costs; don’t assume that 20k will buy you a shuttle, or something.",
Crazypants,,cost_level,6,"100,000+ credits, average 250,000. This is fuck-you money.",
Kinetic,K,damage_type,1,"Kinetic damage is the transfer of damaging energy when an object in motion (a  st, knife, club, or bullet, for example) impacts with another object (the target). Most melee and  rearms attacks in ict kinetic damage, as would a rolling boulder, swinging pendulum, or explosion-driven fragments. Kinetic armors include impact-resistant plates, shear-thickening liquid and gels that harden upon impact, and ballistic and cut- proof  ber weaves.",
Energy,E,damage_type,2,"Energy damage includes that caused by beam weapons (laser, microwave, particle beam, plasma, etc.) as well as  re and high-energy explosives. Armor that protects against this damage is made of material that re ects or diffuses such energy, dissipates and transfers heat, or ablates.",
Pain,P,damage_type,3,"Causes pain in the target, inflicting –20 to the target’s actions and forcing them to move away from the beam on their next action unless they succeed in a WIL Test. Targets with Level 1 Pain Tolerance or the equivalent only suffer a –10 modifier and roll WIL × 2. Synthetic morphs and biomorphs with Level 2 Pain Tolerance (or the equivalent) are immune to this damage type.",
Shock,S,damage_type,4,"Shock weapons use high-voltage electrical jolts to physically stun and incapacitate targets. Shock weapons are particularly effective against biomorphs and pods, even when heavily armored. Synthmorphs, bots, and vehicles are immune to shock weapon effects.",
Subdual,G,damage_type,5,"A subdued opponent is temporarily restrained or immobilized. They may communicate, use mental skills, and take mesh actions, but they may not take any physical actions other than trying to break free. To break free, a grappled character must take a Complex Action and succeed in either an Opposed Unarmed Combat Test or an Opposed SOM × 3 Test with a –30 modifier.",
Payload,D,damage_type,6,"Payload effects deliver a given substance (like a toxin, a drug, or a chemical) to the target on impact.",
Melee,M,damage_type,7,"Melee damage is (by definition) kinetic; however, melee attacks also receive a bonus equivalent to the attacker’s SOM / 10.",
Psi,X,damage_type,8,Psi damage is caused by offensive psi sleights like Psychic Stab.,
Minor,,derangement_magnitude,1,Derangements are temporary mental conditions that result from traumas.,
Moderate,,derangement_magnitude,2,Derangements are temporary mental conditions that result from traumas.,
Major,,derangement_magnitude,3,Derangements are temporary mental conditions that result from traumas.,
Disorder,,derangement_magnitude,4,"Disorders reflect more permanent madness. In this case, “permanent” does not necessarily mean forever, but the condition is ongoing until the character receives lengthy and effective psychiatric help. Disorders are inflicted whenever a character accumulates 4 traumas. The gamemaster and player should choose a disorder that fits the situation and character.",

Single Shot,SS,firing_modes,,Single shot weapons may only be  red once per Complex Action. These are typically larger or more archaic devices.,
Semi-Automatic,SA,firing_modes,,"Semi-automatic weapons are capable of quick, repeated  re. They may be  red twice with the same Complex Action. Each shot is handled as a separate attack.",
Burst Fire,BF,firing_modes,,"Burst fire weapons release a number of quick shots (a “burst”) with a single trigger pull. Two bursts may be red with the same Complex Action. Each burst is handled as a separate attack. Bursts use up 3 shots worth of ammunition. 

A burst may be shot against a single target (concentrated re) or against two targets who are standing within one meter of each other. In the case of concentrated re against a single target, the attacker can choose either a +10 modifier to hit or increase the DV by +1d10. ",
Full Auto,FA,firing_modes,,"Full-auto weapons release a hail of shots with a single trigger pull. Only one full-auto attack may be made with each Complex Action. This attack may be made on a single target or against up to three separate targets, as long as each is within one meter of another. In the case of concentrated fire on a single individual, the attacker can choose either a +30 modifier to hit or increase the DV by +3d10. Firing in full automatic mode uses up 10 shots.",
Drone,,humint_access_level,1,"A low-level position in a small-to-moderate level institution. This might be an indentured corp employee, a street thug a or a script-kiddie hacker. They will have a Profession skill at 40 and one other at 30. They can provide some basic insider information but nothing classified or sensitive, such as office chatter or the next day's orders.",
Line Manager,,humint_access_level,2,"An established position in their institution. This might be a mob lieutenant, a moderately respected scientist or a Direct Action squad leader. They will have a Profession skill at 40 and one other at 40. They will have access to some moderately sensitive information such as the location to a small drophouse.",
Middle Management,,humint_access_level,3,"A respected person in their institution, occupying a fairly secure position. This might be a junior executive, a notable hacktivist or a media darling. They will have a Profession at 50 and one other at 50. They will have access to some classified intel such as the secret drug habit of a minor politician.",
Major Domo,,humint_access_level,4,"Someone in a quite high position within their organization, in a position of some authority or respect. They might be a mob under-boss, the head of a department at TAU or a senior Oversight auditor. They will have a Profession at 60 and one others at 60. They will have access to highly classified intel such as the location of an oligarch's private hab.",
Beating Heart,,humint_access_level,5,"Though not a faction head, they are extremely well-placed within that faction. They might be the head of a hypercorp research facility, the most respected member of a certain Scum Swarm or (with GM permission) placed within Project Ozma. They will have a Profession at 70 and one other at 70. They will have access to top-secret intelligence such as the details of ongoing weapons R&D.",
Casual Acquaintance,,humint_bond_level,1,"The HumInt has agreed to do small favors for the agent but has no great investment in their well-being; they will not be great friends or relatives and are unlikely to be full members of the same organization. At this level, they will do 1-rep favors with no questions asked.",
Fellow Traveler,,humint_bond_level,2,"The HumInt has some degree of affection or loyalty towards the agent or their cause; they might have some off-the-job contact or belong to the same interest groups. At this level, they will do favours up to level 2 with no questions asked.",
Sworn In,,humint_bond_level,3,"The HumInt might be a relative, romantic partner or fellow agent; they have strong interest in the well-being of the agent. They will do favors up to level 3 no questions asked.",
Loyalist,,humint_bond_level,4,"The HumInt might be a sibling, spouse or a former partner-in-crime of the agent and are willing to do almost anything for them. They will do favors up to level 4 no questions asked.",
Fanatic,,humint_bond_level,5,"At this level, the HumInt would be willing to do anything for the agent. They might be a blood-brother, a die-hard believer in the same cause or a soul-mate. They will do any favour no questions asked.",
Borderline,,humint_resource_level,1,"The HumInt has enough to get by but not much room for luxury. They probably live in cramped conditions with barely enough room for themselves, let alone other people; they may even be homeless. They have an unaugmented morph - probably a Case or Flat - and can be squeezed for up to 500 credits. They might be indentures, low level criminals or Titanian reboots.",
Comfortable,,humint_resource_level,2,"The HumInt lives moderately well. They can afford small upgrades to their morph - which is probably a Splicer or Exalt - and might have room to house one or two others in their accommodation. They might be squeezed for up to the equivalent of 2000 credits before they encounter difficulties. Hypercorp employees, small Extropian operations or Scum might be at this level.",
Affluent,,humint_resource_level,3,"Before the Fall, someone like this would have lived in the walled-off sectors; they have far more than they need and probably have extensive mods on their morph - perhaps a Sylph or Fury. They could be tapped for the equivalent of up to 10K credits of disposable income and goods. Hyperelite scions and the glitterati or lauded members of an anarchist collective might have this level of Resources to spare.",
Privileged,,humint_resource_level,4,"Someone like this probably was born with a silver spoon in their mouths and has enough for a dozen lifetimes. Their morphs might be anything and are likely highly customized. They can be tapped for up to 25K credits in goods or services or have some other significant holding the agent can make use of, such as a private lab. Titanian Ministers, Lunar bankers or veteran gatecrashers might have this level of resources.",
Obscene,,humint_resource_level,5,People like this are few and far between; they might have been born into an oligarch's dynasty or have bootstrapped themselves up to being richer than God. They likely have unique morphs made by famed designers. They can be tapped for up to 50K credits in goods and services and have extensive holdings the agent might call on.,
Dabbler,,humint_talent_level,1,"The HumInt has a fairly normal level of knowledge or skills. This is the man in the crowd, the average student and GED. They have two skills at 30.",
Hobbyist,,humint_talent_level,2,The HumInt has developed their skillset slightly beyond the normal means. They might have been raised bilingual or spend their weekends at the shooting range. They have one skill at 40 and two at 30.,

Hopper,,mobility_type,1,"Hoppers have two or more legs designed to propel the morph forward or up, much like a frog or grasshopper.",4/20/20
Hovercraft,,mobility_type,2,"The shell uses an impeller to blast a cushion of high-pressure air off the surface below, repelling the frame off the ground (modern hovercraft do not use rubber skirts). Most hovercraft travel a meter or so above the ground, but can temporarily levitate themselves higher for short periods.",8/40/40
Internal Rocket,,mobility_type,3,"This miniature metallic hydrogen rocket is specifically designed for low thrust. It provides an acceleration of up to 0.25 g, allowing the morph to take off and land on all moons and other small bodies in the solar system. This engine can operate for a total of one and a half hours before it requires refueling.",12/60/60
Ionic,,mobility_type,4,"The shell uses principles of magnetohydrodynamics to levitate and fly, by ionizing surrounding air into plasma to create lift and momentum. The shell is also spun for stability. This system does not work in vacuum, but an underwater version uses the same mechanics for propulsion in liquid environments.",8/40/40
Microlight,,mobility_type,5,"Popular in low-grav and microgravity environments, microlights encompass several types of ultralight or lighter-than-air systems, such as powered paragliders, autogyros, balloons, aerostats, and blimps. These systems do not work in vacuum. ",8/40/40
Roller,,mobility_type,6,"Only for circular shells, this system allows the synthmorph to roll like a ball. The shell rolls around an interior axle, propelled by a motor-driven pendulum. ",8/32/32
Rotorcraft,,mobility_type,7,"Rotating blades create lift, allowing the shell to move and hover like a helicopter. Most models use tilt-rotors or tilt-wings so that the rotor- blades may be moved forward (for faster propeller-like propulsion) and for better maneuverability in zero-G. This system does not work in vacuum.",8/36/36
Snake,,mobility_type,8,"Commonly used by slitheroids, these shells use lateral undulation,  exing their body from left to right and waving their frame forward. Such shells may also use sidewinding or a concertina motion (straight- ening forward, then retracting the rear) to move. They also featured gyroscope stabilization so that they may circle into a hoop and roll like a wheel.",4/16/16
Submarine,,mobility_type,9,"Designed for undersea mobility, submarine shells use propellers or pumpjets to push through water.",4/36/36
Thrust Vector,,mobility_type,10,These shells use either turbofans or turbojets to create atmospheric lift with a set of wings. The engines may be maneuvered to point and generate thrust in different directions for vertical takeoffs/landings and better maneuverability in zero-G.,8/40/40
Tracked,,mobility_type,11,Tracked shells use smart rotating treads to work their way across surfaces that would bog down other ground vehicles. They can prop themselves up in order to overcome taller obstacles or to lay them- selves down to bridge across a ditch or crevice.,4/16/16
Walker,,mobility_type,12,Walkers use two or more limbs to walk or crawl across a surface. Many use grip pads or magnetic systems to stick to surfaces. ,4/20/20
Wheeled,,mobility_type,13,Most wheeled shells feature smart spokes that allow the wheels to conform their shape to obstacles and even climb stairs. Some low-grav shells feature puncture-resistant and self-repairing compressed-gas tires.,8/40/40
Winged,,mobility_type,14,"Primarily used by smaller shells, this system of four independently controlled wings allows the shell to hover or move rapidly in any direction.",8/40/40
Biomorph,,morph_type,1,"Biomorphs are fully biological sleeves (usually equipped with implants), birthed naturally or in an exowomb, and grown to adulthood either naturally or at a slightly accelerated rate.",
Pod,,morph_type,2,"Pods (from “pod people”) are vat-grown, biological bodies with extremely undeveloped brains that are augmented with an implanted computer and cybernetics system. Though typically run by an AI, pods are socially unfavored in some stations, used as slave labor in others, and even illegal in some areas. Because pods underwent accelerated growth in their creation and were mostly grown as separate parts and then assembled, their biological design includes some shortcuts and limitations, offset with implants and regular maintenance. They lack reproductive capabilities. In many habitats, their legal status is a hotly contested issue.",
Synthmorph,,morph_type,3,"Synthetic morphs are completely artificial/robotic. They are usually operated by AIs or via remote control, but the lack of available biomorphs after the Fall meant that many infugees resorted to resleeving in robotic shells, which were also cheaper, quicker to manufacture, and more widely available. Nevertheless, synthmorphs are viewed with disdain in many habitats, an option that only the poor and desperate accept to be sleeved in. Synthetic morphs are not without their advantages, however, and so are commonly used for menial labor, heavy labor, habitat construction, and security services. ",
Uplift,,morph_type,4,These custom biological morphs are available only to uplifted creatures.,
Eidelon,,morph_type,5,"The basic infomorph shell is a software mind-emulation package that runs an ego. The default infomorph is much like a digital version of a flat, in that it does not enjoy the cognitive or other aptitude bonuses common to other physical morphs. Other varieties of infomorph shells exist, however. Known as eidolons, these digital morphs include routines that bolster an ego’s innate capabilities and often come equipped with pre-installed plug-ins and upgrades. ",

Constant,,psi_duration,,Constant sleights are always “on.”,
Instant,,psi_duration,,Instant sleights take effect only in the Action Phase in which they are used.,
Temporary,,psi_duration,,"Temporary sleights last for a limited duration with no extra effort from the async. The temporary duration is determined by the async’s WIL ÷ 5 (round up) and is measured in either Action Turns or minutes, as noted. Strain for the sleight is applied immediately when used, not at the end of the duration.",
Sustained,,psi_duration,,"Sustained sleights require active effort to maintain for as long as the async wants to keep it active. Sustaining a sleight requires concentration, and so the async suffers a –10 modifier to all other skill tests while the sleight is sustained. The async must also stay within the range appropriate to the sleight, otherwise the sleight immediately ends. More than one sleight may be sustained at a time, with a cumulative modifier. Strain for the sleight is applied immediately when used, not at the end of the duration. At the gamemaster’s discretion, sleights that are sustained for long periods may incur additional strain.",
Chi,,psi_level,1,Psi-chi sleights are async abilities that speed up cognitive informatics (internal information processing) and enhance the user’s perception and cognition.,
Gamma,,psi_level,2,"Psi-gamma sleights deal with contacting (reading and communicating) and in uencing the function of biological minds (egos within a biomorph, but also including animal life). Psi-gamma is only available to characters with Level 2 of the Psi trait.

Most psi-gamma use is handled as an Opposed Test between the async and the target (p. 222). ",
Epsilon,,psi_level,3,"Psi-epsilon is available to exsurgents with the Psi trait at Level 3. This subset of psi involves abilities that can affect the underlying physical nature of the universe, creating localized reality-altering effects. Psi manipulation on this level is extremely dangerous and should have the potential of disastrous consequences, given that these manipulations violate fundamental laws of nature and sometimes create paradoxes between the forces that glue the universe together. Gamemasters are also encouraged to treat critical failures as appropriately critical.

Given these factors, psi-epsilon should only be accessible to powerful adversaries and used as a gamemaster tool with extreme precaution. The exact mechanics of psi-epsilon sleights are left wide open, for whatever use the gamemaster can dream of. Their intent is to be more cinematic than mechanical, so Given these factors, psi-epsilon should only be accessible to powerful adversaries and used as a gamemaster tool with extreme precaution. The exact mechanics of psi-epsilon sleights are left wide open, for whatever use the gamemaster can dream of. Their intent is to be more cinematic than mechanical, so 

At the gamemaster’s discretion, simply observing psi-epsilon sleights in action may inflict 1d10 + 2 mental stress on a character (p. 214). ",
Self,,psi_range,1,These sleights only affect the async.,
Touch,,psi_range,2,"Sleights with a Touch range may be used against other biological life, but the async must have physical contact with the target. If the target avoids being touched, this requires a successful melee attack, applying the touch-only +20 modifier. This attack does not cause damage and is considered part of the same action as the psi use.",
Close,,psi_range,3,"Close sleights involve interaction with other biological life from a short distance. The optimal distance is within 5 meters. For each meter beyond that, apply a –10 modifier to the test.",

This category also includes infectious biological organisms that can produce drug-like effects, like viruses and bacteria. Biologicals affect biomorphs and pods but not synthetic morphs or infomorphs.",
Nanotech,,substance_type,,"These are temporary nanobot colonies programmed to create a certain effect. While nano- bots are generally able to target or infect all morph types except infomorphs, exactly which morphs are affected usually depends on the pre-programmed effect (i.e., whether it targets a biological or mechanical mechanism).",
Electronic,,substance_type,,"Electronic drugs include software and technology that affect the brain directly, such as manipulative XP programs or retro-tech like transcranial magnetic stimulation or cranial electrotherapy.

Guardian nanoswarms, immunogenic coatings, and nanophages must be overcome first, this requires an Opposed Test between the defense’s skill of 30 and the nanoplague’s Infection Rating. At the GM’s discretion, additional guardian swarms may provide a +10 modifier. If the nanoplague wins, the target is infected in 10 Action Turns, −1 turn per 10 full points of MoS.",
Digital Virus,D,vector,,"The digital virus may infect any AIs, infomorphs, or even inactive backups by targeting them on their home device (p. 143, Transhuman). Cyberbrains may be similarly targeted. Treat this as an Opposed Test, pitting the victim’s Infosec skill vs. the virus’s Infection Rating. (Inactive backups get no defense.) Active Countermeasures (p. 140, Transhuman) provides a +10 bonus. If the digital virus wins, the target is infected in 10 Action Turns, −1 turn per 10 full points of MoS.

Targets that succeed but lose the test are aware of the pending infection and suffer SV 1d10. They may attempt to shut down and reboot or otherwise sever the connection, but if they fail another Infosec vs. Infection Rating Opposed Test, the virus has already embedded itself and will continue the infection upon rebooting. ",
Basilisk Hack,B,vector,,"A character exposed to a basilisk hack deployed for sensory reprogramming must make an Opposed Test between their COG + INT + SAV against the basilisk’s Infection Rating. If the basilisk succeeds, the character is catatonic and paralyzed for 10 minutes, −1 minute per 10 full points of MoS. At the end of this period they are infected.
