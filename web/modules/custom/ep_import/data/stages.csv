Strain,Stage,Description,Timeframe,Stress,Weight
Haunting,Stage 1,"Upon initial infection, the character suffers 1d10 mental stress and gains the Psi trait (p. 147, EP) at Level 1 (also meaning they pick up the Mental Disorder trait, as noted on p. 150). They also gain one free psi-chi sleight, chosen randomly or by the gamemaster. If a player character has become infected, they may still be played as normal (see Roleplaying Exsurgents, p. 369) and may purchase new psi-chi sleights with Rez Points. NPCs acquire 1 new sleight per 2–4 weeks.

At this stage, the infection is usually hidden, though the character will suffer from occasional haunting effects (see below). As each week passes, the character’s personality should shift a minute amount, slowly becoming more callous and conniving and changing in other ways as well. If possible, the player should be kept in the dark about what is happening, but the gamemaster should provide them with roleplaying advice to reaect their condition. Likewise, the discovery and initial use of psi sleights should be played out, providing some interesting roleplaying opportunities. Characters and players who know of the exsurgent virus and Watts-MacLeod strains should not know at this point which strain they are infected with—make them sweat.",0-12w,1d10,1
Haunting,Stage 2,"The target suffers another 1d10 ÷ 2 (round up) mental stress and acquires the Psi trait at Level 2 (also picking up another disorder). Player characters may still be played as normal and may purchase psi-gamma slights with Rez Points. NPCs acquire 1 new sleight per 2–4 weeks.

Once three months have passed, the character should be aware they are under the influence of something, but this awareness likely comes too late. Haunting effects should occur regularly. At this point a character is likely to consider seeking help, actively encouraging others to interfere, or offing themselves and resorting to an uninfected backup. The infection will actively block and hinder such thoughts and actions, however. To actively overcome this mental control, the character must succeed in a WIL Test. At the gamemaster’s discretion, failure may result in 1d10 ÷ 2 (round up) mental stress as the character realizes they are no longer fully in control of their own thoughts and actions.",12w-24w,1d10 / 2,2
Haunting,Stage 3,The victim suffers another 1d10 ÷ 2 (round up) mental stress and acquires the Psi trait at Level 3. The character is now considered an exsurgent and becomes an NPC. It may no longer be played as a player character. The victim also gains a permanent +5 bonus to COG and WIL and acquires 1 new sleight every 1–2 months.,24w,1d10 / 2,3
Xenomorph,Stage 1,"The effects from Stage 1 of the haunting virus apply. Additionally, the character begins to suffer minor physical changes that are de nitely unusual but are not impeding in any way and are easily hidden from others. Example biomorph alterations might be: unusual hair or  brous growth, some skin discoloration or translucence, severe rashes, dermal thickening, weakened or enhanced sensory organs, strong body odor, hair loss, teeth gain or loss, vestigial tail or other limb growth, minor dietary changes, and so on. Synthmorphs might experience minor system glitches, malfunctioning or improved components, and spots of material stress or trans guration. Gamemasters are encouraged to be creative. This stage typically lasts from initial infection to 1 week for biological nanovirus strains, or from infection to just 1 hour for nanoplague strains.",,,1
Xenomorph,Stage 2,"As with haunting virus Stage 2, plus the character begins to seriously transmogrify in ways that are dif cult to hide from others, becoming more and more monstrous as the stage progresses. Example biomorph transformations include: growing scales or feathers, partial modi cation of limb structure, partial new limb growth, vestigial sensory organ growth, sensory loss, extension of claws or spines, severe dietary changes, etc. Synthmorphs might experience radical system and shape alterations, limited or enhanced sensor functions, or even conversion of their robotic shell to smart materials. These physical changes weaken the victim, in icting 1d10 physical damage. This stage typically lasts 1 week for biological nanovirus strains or just 1 hour for nanoplague strains.",,,2
Xenomorph,Stage 3,"As with haunting virus Stage 3, a character reaching this stage becomes an NPC. Additionally, the victim completely undergoes a transformation into some sort of creature that is no longer even remotely human. Example exsurgents of this nature are detailed on p. 367.",,,3
Chrynalus,Digital Infection,"The digital virus operates as described on p. 364, EP. Any AIs, infomorphs, or cyberbrains that become infected do not immediately become exsurgents, however. Instead, they suffer 1d10 − 2 SV per hour and are inflicted with paranoia, delusions, hallucinations, and other mental disorders as they descend into madness.",,,1
Chrynalus,Basilisk Hack,"At normal speed, the hack is an audible series of dissonant tones. At a slower speed, it plays at a frequency barely noticeable to the unaugmented ear and may ride on something as innocuous as radio static. This hack follows the rules for incapacitating inputs (p. 365, EP). Many victims fall prey to the basilisk hack, which keeps them incapacitated until the nano- plague converts them to exsurgents.",,,2
Chrynalus,Stage 1,"Infected characters and items display no outward signs of infection at first. The first stage of infec- tion attacks the host’s cognitive functions even as nanobots co-opt nerve tissue for the virus’s purpose. Intense, terrifying hallucinations quickly drive even resilient minds insane. Inside the character or item, the nanobots build up strange synthetic growths. Victims acuire the Mental Disorder (Hallucinations) trait.",0-3h,1d10 - 2 per hour,3
Chrynalus,Stage 2,"The infection becomes visible as the growing masses inside the body—called chrysacids—pierce the surface and start growing. Infected characters continue to be plagued by nightmarish visions and suffer even further as they watch the chrysacids first puncture their skin or shell, taking an additional SV 2d10.",3h-1d,1d10 - 2 per hour,4
Chrynalus,Stage 3,"Stage three sees chrysacids growing into limbs up to three meters in length and exhibiting a life of their own, engaging in limited autonomous movement and sensory processing. Most victims become insane exsurgents by this point, attacking anything they see. As the chrysacids grow, they drain the life from their biological hosts. Biomorphs suffers 1d10 DV per day.",1d-1w,1d10 - 2 per hour,5
Chrynalus,Stage 4,"The larger chrysacid growths eventually break off, scurrying about as independent critters. Biomorphs eventually succumb and die, but the chrysacid growths live on.",1w,1d10 - 2 per hour,6
Chrynalus,Chrysacid exsurgents,"The psychic assault on the victim’s mind remains a constant throughout infection and eventually renders victims incapable of technical skills and all higher thought. Characters who reach their Lucidity in stress become exsurgents. While biomorph exsurgents do not last, synthmorphs and machines will continue to sprout new chrysacid growths as long as the nano- plague has access to raw materials. See p. 99 for more details on chrysacid exsurgents.",,,7
Brancusi,Stage 1,"During the first 10 minutes of infection, the char- acter begins to lose control of their body. Each Action Turn they must make a WIL x 3 Test to direct their own physical actions, otherwise their morph will move of its own accord. Most actions seem random, often taking poses or testing the morph’s range of movement, but they will sometimes be erratic, jerky, or even violent, under the virus’s control.",0-10m,1d10 + 3,1
Brancusi,Stage 2,"Against their will, the character freezes in place, usually posing in an unnatural manner. Then, over the next hour, they will undergo a transformation. Organic components of the morph are typically shed in a horrific display of gore, though in some cases they are simply transformed into a new, immobile biological form. Most infected will keep some of their old appearance in their new form. It will generally have a recognizable face and parts of its body can be seen embedded in the machine. Some could serve mundane purposes, such as server farms, heat sinks, or defense systems. Others are designed with unknowable TITAN interests in mind, or are simply broken or incomplete. Every brancusi has its own unique design and features. If a group of morphs are infected at the same time, they are usually merged into a cluster, their bodies wrapping around each other, a single gestalt sculpture.

At this stage, egos have no control over their morph, but they may still act mentally or even evacuate the morph if they have a cyberbrain. As each hour passes, however, the virus will slowly transform their mind.",10m,1d10 + 5 per hour,2
Brancusi,Brancusi Exsurgents,"When their stress reaches their Lucidity, the infected become exsurgents. They will attempt to hack every uninfected system they can mesh with (treat as the digital exsurgent virus, p. 364, EP). Nanofabbers will be hacked to create brancusi nanoplagues, while infomorphs and other egos will be attacked with other strains of the virus.

Brancusi fixtures have Armor 20/20, Durability 60, and they self-repair 1d10 DV every hour. Viewing a brancusi exsurgent or their transformation requires a WIL x 3 Test. Failure causes 1d10 ÷ 2 mental stress. Particularly bizarre, alien, or gory brancusis may inflict extra stress at the GM’s discretion.

Cluster Mind: The brancusi becomes a server, housing hundreds of egos chained together to form a gestalt mind. It is completely insane, babbling incom- prehensibly in a hundred voices at once, both vocally and through open mesh communications.

Exo-Womb: The exsurgent houses an exo-womb, growing nightmarish exsurgent xenomorph life forms or something even more disturbing. Examining an exo-womb requires a WIL x 3 Test or the character suffers 1d10 mental stress.

Monomolecular Web: Monomolecular thread is webbed around the area of the exsurgent. Detecting it requires a successful Perception test at a −10 penalty. A moving character attempting to avoid a spotted thread must make an appropriate Free Fall, Freerunning, or Fray Test. Moving into a thread in icts DV 2d10, AP −8, and breaks the thread.

Nano-Hive: Brancusi exsurgents build and release nanoplague swarms in the local area, at the rate of 1 swarm per day, as long as suf cient raw materials are available. These swarms will attempt to infect all morphs, machines, and biological life in the area. Space-Time Anomaly: The brancusi exsurgent generates a localized anomaly in space-time, part of an abandoned TITAN research project. Its appearance varies: perhaps a rotating fractal energy eld, what appears to be a two-meter black hole, or a mirror that seems to reflect what happens one second in the future. Whatever it is, transhuman science cannot explain it. Merely viewing may require a WIL x 3 Test to avoid taking anywhere from 1 to 2d10 mental stress (GM’s discretion). If a character succeeds with an appropriate Knowledge skill test such as Academics: Physics, they may learn something of the anomaly’s true nature. Full analysis would require years of study, however. Attempting to move or dismantle the exsurgent causes the anomaly to collapse, possibly in a catastrophic manner.",,,3
Babel,Stage 1,"Infected characters experience all languages (both text and auditory) as alien and incomprehensible. They may make a COG x 3 Test to successfully interpret any language input (including Babel) for 1 Action Turn. Any time the character attempts to communicate using languages they know, they must make a COG x 3 Test to effectively communicate, otherwise they spout gibberish (which sounds fine to them). The hyper linguist implant or trait provides a +30 modi er to these tests. 
Additionally, the infected acquire the Mental Disorder (Delusions) trait, as non-Babel-speaking people look increasingly like aliens in disguise.",0-12h,1d10,1
Babel,Stage 2,"The infected character speaks completely in Babel language, which acts as a basilisk hack to others. They also acquire the Mental Disorder (Compulsion: Logorrhea) trait, meaning that they can’t stop talking. This compulsion manifests as an incontrollable desire to make a communication breakthrough with others, to make them understand, to try and figure out whether they are actually aliens in disguise. Infectees will attempt to “communicate” with as many people as possible.

At this stage, infected characters are completely unable to understand other languages. However, characters with the hyper linguist implant or trait may still attempt to communicate or understand languages as normal with a COG x 2 Test, though they experience these attempts as communicating via an alien language.",12-24h,1d10,2
Babel,Stage 3,"Infected characters gain the Mental Disorder (Paranoia) trait, believing that the non-infected are exsurgents out to get them and that an attack is imminent. The infected will band together, arm up, and barricade themselves in secure areas. They will also be compelled to take non-infected people as hostages, whom they will attempt to talk to, likely infecting them. Others may try to spread the virus by broadcasting excerpts of the Babel language.",,1d10 per day,3
Babel,Babel Exsurgents,"Once their stress reaches their Lucidity, characters become exsurgents under the virus’s dominion. They become violent and irrational, attacking any non- exsurgents they encounter. They retain their technical and weapon skills, and will use whatever means they have to defend themselves and infect others.",,,4
Glory,Glory AOK Hack,"To absorb the basilisk hack fully, one must have sufcient technical background: Hardware: Electronics or Programming at 60 or more. Once infected, they acquire the Mental Disorder (Obsession) trait and drop everything to build the hive. Constructing such a hive requires a Hardware: Electronics (with access to materials) or Programming Test (and access to a fabber); this is a Task Action with a 1 week timeframe. Nanoplagues created by the hive are then used to infect others.",,,1
Glory,Stage 1,"The infection modi es the victim’s behavior, turning them into a cunning and aggressive sociopath with a yen for cannibalism. It also instills infected hosts with a nesting instinct and a strong desire to infect a potential mate, either by seduction or force. Treat this as the Mental Disorder (OCD), Modi ed Behavior (Encouraged: Cannibalism, Nesting, Obey Breeders/ Mother), and Socially Graceless traits. The subject’s personality is slowly eroded over time, pushing them down a slow descent into madness. Glory-infected characters will cooperate with other immolators, but everyone else in the universe is prey.

There is a 50/50 chance of becoming an immolator breeder or drone, unless the colony has already reached its capacity on breeders (if no colony yet exists, the victim will become the immolator mother and start one). Breeders and mothers move on to stage 2, immolator drones never progress beyond stage 1.",0-1h,1d10,2
Glory,Stage 2,"In this stage, the infected begin the physical trans- formation into immolator breeder exsurgents (or the mother, if rst). This physical transformation takes one week.

Victims acquire the Psi trait at Level 1, plus one free psi-chi sleight, and may purchase others with Rez points. NPCs acquire new sleights every 2–4 weeks. After one week, they acquire Level 2 of the Psi trait.

At stage 2, the urge to engage in cannibalism, nest, breed, and obey mother is overwhelming. Their Modified Behavior trait switches from Encouraged to Enforced.",1h,1d10 + 3 per day,3
Glory,Immolator Exsurgents,"Whenever a character’s accumulated stress equals their Lucidity, they become an exsurgent.",,,4
Skrik,Stage 1,"During stage 1, the victim’s mind is slowly but surely subverted by the virus. They are aware of this assault, and will suffer −30 to all actions as they run the gamut of fear, pain, confusion, catatonia, retching, and convulsions. Once complete, the victim is an exsurgent under the virus’s control.",0-5m,1d10 + 3 per minute,1
Skrik,Stage 2,"After 1 week, the victim’s internal changes will be complete. From this point onward, every 2–3 days the exsurgent will vomit up a skrik (p. 136)—a miniature version of themself. Sometimes they will cough the skriks up more frequently, and sometimes they will vomit up a whole bunch at once.",5m,,2
Skrik,Skrik Exsurgents,"Skrik exsurgents are primarily motivated to spread the virus. They will try and capture the skriks they cough up so as to covertly include them in others’ meals. If they resleeve, they will make sure to infect the new morph.",,,3
Stockholm,Stage 1,"Upon initial infection, the character gains the Psi trait at Level 1 along with the Enhanced Creativity psi-chi sleight. They may purchase new chi slights at standard Rez point costs. NPCs gain 1 new sleight every 2 to 4 weeks. The victim is also afflicted with the Mental Disorder (Body Dysmorphia) trait, viewing their own morph (and all other transhuman-created morphs) as unnatural and disgusting. They are compelled to create artwork that depicts their idealized body type or seek out cosmetic body modifications that make them appear more alien, though they may resist this impulse with a successful WIL x 3 Test once per month. They also typically become obsessed with the Fall and will voyeuristically watch footage of exsurgents over and over again.

During this time, the victim will rationalize their change as an “awakening,” a realization that exsurgents are not evil, but the next stage of evolution for transhumanity. Infected characters will also suffer from various side effects, which are listed below. The GM has discretion as to which ones affect the character at this stage.",0-26w,1d10,1
Stockholm,Stage 2,"The character acquires Level 2 of the Psi trait and the Cloud Memory gamma psi-sleight. They also pick up the Mental Disorder (OCD) trait, which manifests as an obsession with protecting and aiding active exsurgents. If the character fails to protect an exsurgent from harm, they suffer 1d10 ÷ 2 mental stress. They must pass a WIL Test to harm an exsurgent and suffer SV 1d10 for doing so. Other exsurgents will not attack the character except to defend themselves

Characters may realize they are infected at this point, but will probably see this as beneficial. They may try to seek help or restore themselves from an uninfected backup, but this requires a WIL Test. Failure indicates that the virus exerts itself and prevents the character from acting out; they suffer an additional SV 1d10.

At this stage, the victim must no longer make Stress Tests from encountering exsurgents, but they must still make a Stress Test if they see an exsurgent attack a loved one or friend. The character may still find it difficult to rationalize violence against their loved ones.

Note that the character has suffered no physical change at this point, except any self-inflicted changes.",26w-52w,1d10,2
Stockholm,Stage 3,"The victim now gains the Mental Disorder (Obsession) trait and becomes fixated on becoming a full xenomorph exsurgent. The longer they go without transitioning, the more they will believe they have failed in some way, perhaps spurring them to spread the virus to others.",52w,1d10 per week,3
Stockholm,Stockholm Exsurgents,"Whenever a character’s accumulated stress equals their Lucidity, they become an exsurgent. Over the next hour (nanoplague) or week (bio-pathogen), they will physically transmogrify into a xenomorph exsurgent.",,,4
Stockholm,Side Effects,"Characters with this strain suffer from unique side effects. The following examples provide some ideas for GMs, or they can develop their own:

Religious Ideation and Fixation: The character develops a personal mythology on how the exsurgents are spiritual saviors of transhumanity. They may be seen as angels, the key to Nirvana, or something even more esoteric. They will create rituals of worship, prayers, holy text, and acts of devotion such as self- mutilation. The character will probably keep their beliefs secret because they will know that praising exsurgents is a good way to get killed and have their backups erased. However, in isolated environments, the character may try to convert others, typically through extreme methods such as psychosurgery, torture, or the use of async sleights.

Hallucinations: The character experiences vivid hallucinations for 1d10 minutes at random intervals. These hallucinations typically depict the Fall as a glorious religious experience and exsurgents as supreme beings worthy of worship. Normal trans- humans become pitiable freaks. A character can hide their reaction from others by making a WIL x 3 Test. If the test fails, then the character noticeably reacts to the hallucinations, which will probably alert others.

Increased Infectiousness: A character with this side effect becomes far more infectious. The virus becomes airborne and contaminates any surface the character touches for 1d10 hours. Anyone who breathes the same air as the character or touches the same surface as the character risks infection. In addition, the character’s exsurgent nature becomes more detectable to biohazard sensors. Tests made to detect the virus no longer suffer a −20 penalty.",,,5
Haunting,Stage 1,"Upon initial infection, the character suffers 1d10 mental stress and gains the Psi trait (p. 147) at Level 1 (also meaning they pick up the Mental Disorder trait, as noted on p. 150).

It may no longer be played as a player character. The victim also gains a permanent +5 bonus to COG and WIL and acquires 1 new sleight every 1–2 months.,26w,1d10 / 2,
,Side Effects,"As noted above, characters infected with this strain suffer from different haunting effects—changes to their personality or mental state. A few ideas for haunting effects are noted here, but gamemasters are encouraged to be creative when inventing their own to apply:

Altered Perceptions: The victim’s perceptions are changed in disturbing and unusual ways. They may see things that aren’t there, feel a presence behind or watching them, inexplicably smell blood, hear voices, suffer synaesthesia, or suddenly perceive the people around them as nothing but outlandish, blabbering sacks of meat.

Behavioral Modification: Treat as behavioral control or personality editing psychosurgery (p. 229). This is typically applied to shape the character closer to being a pawn of the ETI.

Dream Manipulation: The character’s dreams become lucid, weird, and surreal. They may nd themselves dreaming of life as an alien on some exotic exoplanet, as a robotic probe soaring through the vast emptiness of space, or fantasizing different methods of inflicting mass destruction and death.

Emotional Manipulation: Treat as emotional control psychosurgery (p. 231). 

Inexplicable Urges: The character will be flushed with strange alien urges and may sometimes find themselves doing highly unusual things without realizing at all they are doing it. These may include taking devices apart to understand how they work, testing the limits on programming a nanofabricator, cutting a living thing apart to see how it is put together biologically, testing weapons, eating things that are only barely edible, promiscuous and unusual sexual activity, lying just to see what they can get away with, and so on.",,,
