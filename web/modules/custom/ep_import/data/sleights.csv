This sleight does not provide any understanding of the principles or technologies involved: the psi user simply grasps how to make it work.

Languages may be comprehended by reading or listening to them being spoken.

Predictive Boost,Chi,Passive,Automatic,Self,Constant,,,"The Bayesian probability machine features of the async's brain are boosted by this sleight, enhancing their ability to estimate and predict outcomes of events around them as they unfold in real-time and update those predictions as information changes. In effect, the character has a more intuitive sense for which outcomes are most likely. This grants the character a +10 bonus on any skill tests that involve predicting the outcome of events.

The advantage is that the unconscious mind acts more quickly, and so the async's Speed is boosted by +1. The character remains aware and active, but is incapable of complex communication or other mental actions and is motivated by instinct and primitive urges more than conscious thought.

If successful, the async has detected that the life form is nearby.

This can be useful for """"archiving"""" important data with an ally, providing a literal alternate perspective, or simply making a ""data dump"" for the target to peruse.
