Animal Handling,Social,SAV,,"Skilled animal handlers are able to train and control a wide variety of natural and transgenic animals, including partial uplifts. Though many animal species went extinct during the Fall, a few ark and zoo habitats keep some species alive, and many others can be resurrected from genetic samples. Exotic animals are considered a sign of prestige among the hypercorp elites, and guard animals are occasionally used to protect high-security installations. Likewise, many habitats and settlements employ small armies of partially uplifted, genetically modi ed, and behavior- controlled creatures for sanitation or other purposes. Many new and strange breeds of animal are created daily to serve a variety of roles.","Animal Handling is used whenever you are trying to manipulate an animal, whether your intent is to calm it down, keep it from attacking, intimidate it, acquire its trust, or goad it into attacking. Your Margin of Success determines how effective you are at convincing the creature. At the gamemaster’s discretion, modifiers may be applied to the test. Likewise, winning an animal over may sometimes take time and so could be handled as a Task Action with a timeframe of five minutes or more.",,,Per animal species

Impersonation,Social,SAV,,"Impersonation is the skill of trying to pass yourself off as someone else in social situations, including virtual ones. This includes copying mannerisms and speech patterns and using accumulated information to convince others that you are that person. In a universe where appearance is highly variable, the question of identity is largely one of both trust and picking up on behavioral quirks and verbal cues to recognize a given individual.","Sometimes it’s fun to pretend you’re someone else, and sometimes it’s profitable or lifesaving. Use this skill whenever you attempt to convince someone that you are actually someone else through some sort of social or online interaction.

For example, Investigation could be used to determine the likely sequence of events at a crime scene, determine a possible social connection between two people, or deduce how an enemy made their escape.

Kinesics,Social,SAV,,Kinesics is the art of empathy and nonvocal communication.,"Use Kinesics to read body language, tells, social cues, and other subconscious indicators. It can also be used to emote more effectively. Kinesics is used defensively whenever someone is trying to deceive you; make an Opposed Test against that person’s Deception or Impersonation skill.

Though synthetic morphs are also designed to emote, reading them is not as easy. Apply a –30 modifier when judging a synthetic morph inhabited by a character or AGI. Likewise, standard AIs are also difficult to read; apply a –60 modifier when judging a synthetic morph or pod operated by an AI.

Transhumans are empathic beings and so you can attempt to gauge the demeanor and/or intent of someone you are dealing with by rolling a Kinesics Test. This attempt to read someone is far from exact, however, and it is easy to misjudge. The gamemaster should make this test in secret and only allow a hint if successful—it is not possible to read someone with absolute certainty. If the person being judged is intentionally trying to deceive the character, this should be an Opposed Test against their Deception skill. 

Experts in Kinesics can effectively communicate with each other simply by posture, stances, gestures, demeanors, and looks. Such communication is necessarily limited in the amount of information it can convey, but feelings, attitudes, affirmation/negation, and simple concepts may be passed. To effectively communicate complex concepts, the gamemaster may require successful Kinesics Tests from both parties, applying modifiers as appropriate. ",,,"Judge Intent, Nonvocal Communication"

Perception,Mental,INT,,"Perception is the use of your physical senses (including cybernetic) and awareness of the physical world around you. Perception differs from Investigation in that it is noticing things by chance, rather than actively searching for something.","Use Perception whenever you want to take a detailed account of your surroundings (see Detailed Perception, p. 190). Perception can also be considered an Automatic Action (see Basic Perception, p. 190) and so the gamemaster may call for a Perception Test to determine if you notice something; it is recommended that such tests be rolled secretly by the gamemaster. Perception is also used as an Opposed Test whenever someone around you is trying to be sneaky with Infiltration or Palming.",,,"Aural, Olfactory, Tactile, Taste, Visual"

Nanofabrication is use of Programming skill to create objects using a cornucopia machine, fabber, or maker (see Nanofabricators, p. 327).

Part etiquette, part street-wise, Protocol allows you to navigate treacherous social waters and put people at ease. If the character is dealing with a suspicious or hostile audience, make this an Opposed Test against the target’s WIL + WIL + SAV.

Sometimes a player will make a mistake that their character never would, whether that’s failing to stand in the presence of hypercorp royalty, confusing a gang leader for a peon, or accidentally insulting someone’s heritage. In cases like this, the player may make a Protocol Test for the appropriate eld in order to negate the gaffe.
