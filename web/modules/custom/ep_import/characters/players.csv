I have some questions about some children that I’d like to ask you.","You survived your accelerated growth experience as a member of the Lost generation, the col- lapse of the project, and the scan- dal and witchhunts that followed. You’ve immersed yourself in a new life and identity. Now you put your particular skills and talents to use tracking people as a bounty hunter—a daunting task consider- ing that your targets can change not only their faces but their bodies and sometimes even their memo- ries and mannerisms. All the while you viciously hide your own history and out-maneuver those who want to track your kind down. You are not content to be a victim or a mercenary for others, however. Slowly but surely you are amassing information on those responsible for the Lost project—for what they did to you—and some day you will make them pay.
