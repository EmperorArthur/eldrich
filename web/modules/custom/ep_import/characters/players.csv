Any favors they did by uplifting octopus-kind were rendered moot when they succeeded in despoiling and abandoning the home planet you all shared. Nevertheless, you find all the ruins and derelict habitats left behind by transhumanity to be fascinating to explore, so you spend much of your time combing through spacecraft hulls and shattered stations, look- ing for curiosities and lost treasures. Such activities tend to take you close to Earth as well, where you support the efforts of those who hope to take the planet back. Your ultimate dream is to someday swim in the oceans of your ancestors.","COG:10, COO:20, INT:15, REF:15, SAV:10, SOM:20, WIL:15, MOX:5, SPD:1","Academics: Engineering 50, Academics: Materials Science 50, Academics: Physics 50, Art: Ink Painting 45, Language: Japanese 85, Climbing 30, Demolitions 40, Exotic Ranged: Ink Attack 35, Free Fall 45, Hardware: Electronics 40, Hardware: Industrial 40,     Interests: SpaceshipInfiltration 50, Interests: Post-FallEarth 40, Interests: Ruined Habitats 55, Models 40, Interfacing 30, Investigation 35, Kinetic Weapons 50, Language: Japanese 80, Networking: Autonomists 30, Networking: Criminal 40, Networking: Ecologists 40, Networking: Firewall 30, Networking: Hypercorps 30, Palming 40, Perception 45, Pilot: Aircraft 35, Pilot: Spacecraft 45, Profession: Appraisal 40, Profession: Salvage Ops 60, Scrounging 60, Swimming 50, Unarmed Combat 50",Octomorph,"COG:5, COO:5, INT:5, DUR:30","Basic Biomods, Basic Mesh Inserts, Chameleon Skin, Cortical Stack, Direction Sense, Echolocation, Electrical Sense, Enhanced Vision, Grip Pads, Medichines, Oracles, Radiation Sense","Ambidextrous:2x, Limber (Level 2), 360 Degree Vision, Limbs:8 Tentacles",,"Backup Insurance (Budget):1 month, Breadcrumb Positioning System, Disassembly Tools, Mobile Lab, Nanodetector, Radio Booster, Shelter dome, Specimen Container, Superthermite Charge, Tactical Network Software, X-Ray Emitter",,Octopus Beak; Ink Attack; Medium Pistol,Vacsuit; Crash Suit {Chameleon Coating},,,,,,,,

I have some questions about some children that I’d like to ask you.","You survived your accelerated growth experience as a member of the Lost generation, the col- lapse of the project, and the scan- dal and witchhunts that followed. You’ve immersed yourself in a new life and identity. Now you put your particular skills and talents to use tracking people as a bounty hunter—a daunting task consider- ing that your targets can change not only their faces but their bodies and sometimes even their memo- ries and mannerisms. All the while you viciously hide your own history and out-maneuver those who want to track your kind down. You are not content to be a victim or a mercenary for others, however. Slowly but surely you are amassing information on those responsible for the Lost project—for what they did to you—and some day you will make them pay.
