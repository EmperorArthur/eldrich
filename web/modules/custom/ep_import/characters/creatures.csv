Aquarium Pet,Smart Animal,"Not so much a pet as a prison, aquarium pets are transgenic aquarium animals such as koi, plecos, or axolotls that have been implanted with a ghostrider module. The ghostrider module has no control over the animal’s body but is fully wired into its sensorium as if it were living a real-time XP recording. An ego “sleeved” into an aquarium pet experiences being a  sh, from the sensation of swimming to autonomic drives such as hunger and urination. Many of these sensations, such as the pleco’s rasping at the soft aquarium wood to which it clings with its sucker-like mouth or the koi’s constant ri ing of  lthy bottom gravel with its mouth, are deeply revolting to most transhumans. In addition, the animals used often have good hearing, meaning the sleeved ego can make out conversations outside the tank.

Aquarium pets are physically helpless, as the ego cannot control the animal. The animal behaves instinctively, avoiding nets with a Fray skill of 40 in water, flopping around helplessly out of it. The ghostrider module imposes no modifiers to the ego’s mental stats and is usually connected to a cortical stack, but it has no access to control interfaces.

Egos unwillingly placed into an aquarium pet must make a WIL x 2 Test when rst “sleeved” and every week thereafter. The ego takes 1d10 SV on a failed test. If the aquarium pet dies with the ego in it, the ghostrider module ceases running and may only be re-instanced from the cortical stack (if any). Most aquarium pets have a DUR of 1 or 2. The ghostrider module and stack take up enough space in these creatures that an observer who makes an Academics (Biology) Test or a Perception Test at –20 realizes the animal contains implants, though they won’t know what kind of implants.

Blister Beast,Xenofauna,"A neo-chimp-sized arboreal predator species from the exoplanet Echo IV, blister beasts typically work in small groups. They lurk in the local tree analogs, moving about with impressive leaps and climbing ability. When attacking, they will drop on their prey and inflict a venomous sting or bat them out of the trees with vicious tail paddle strikes. Blister beasts are highly territorial and known to aggressively assault intruders.

Blister beasts evolved the namesake defensive mechanism as a protection from other predators. Their skin is mottled with dozens of pressurized pustules that explosively burst open when they are physically attacked, releasing a spray of noxious neurotoxin goop and a lingering caustic cloud.

Blister beasts can horizontally jump 6 meters (running)/2 meters (standing) and vertically jump 2 meters; +1/0.25/0.25 meters (respectively) per 10 MoS on as Freerunning Test.

Causapod,Neogenetic,"Causapods are an interesting example of successful genetic design gone awry. The original causapod was the winner of a Tharsis League contest to create a new neogenetic creature—a new life form created from scratch (or at least with a minimum threshold of original design; a certain degree of chimerical traits were allowed) and adapted for Mars. Best described as “land octopi,” causapods are multi-limbed, with 4 primary limbs and 6 smaller ones under their mantle. They can skitter along quickly and rapidly climb surfaces they can dig their spikes into. They feature strong jaws which they can use for scooping up lizards or digging up worms, both found in areas with abundant Martian fauna. Breathing vents enable them to survive in the Martian atmosphere, and adaptive coloration provides camouflage among the rocks and soil.

As the contest winner, the causapod’s neogenetic templates were open-sourced. Unexpectedly, the creature’s look became a major hit on the mesh, popularized with “mandibular crawdiddy” memes. This spurred intense interest from various biohacker circles, who quickly ran amok with the open-source designs. Hundreds of variants were genehacked together, many with absurd or dangerous traits: phosphorescent, chittering, slick, acid-spitting, armored/spiked, and even exploding. Anon-affiliated biohackers released some of these dangerous variants for real-life griefing purposes, including harassment of metacelebrities and interference with Consortium development plans.

They attack by slicing their targets or grabbing and pinching. The exsurgent victims—reduced to pure animal instinct—attack anything they see along with their new appendages. As the limbs grow, the victims become less vehicle and more passenger as their own movement becomes impaired and they are dragged about by the sprawling, chitinous limbs.

Creeper,Exsurgent,"Creepers are amorphous clouds of small, black bubbles that spread across and destroy nearly everything they touch, converting all matter into additional creeper mass. Even under enhanced vision and multiple wavelengths, creepers appear out-of-focus and ill-defined due a visual refraction effect. Firewall operates under the theory that creepers are autonomous femtobot swarms, designed by the TITANs as an area-denial weapon and programmed to disassemble everything at the atomic level. Like TITAN nanoswarms, creepers have the capability to manufacture materials and items, including weapons, gases, and mechanical traps, but because they work at an even smaller level they can temporarily create advanced materials with superconducting, supercomputing, superdense, or even invisible properties, among others. These materials are theorized to be constructed from degenerate matter or strange matter fluids, somehow kept stable at standard gravities. Creeper temperatures remain at about 45 C regardless of activity.

Though creeper clouds move slowly, crawling or floating, they sometimes construct mobility systems enabling faster movement. They can penetrate almost any material in a short amount of time, interface with electronics and implants, and convert a standard morph in a matter of minutes. They can transform into a strange matter mass that has a repulsive effect on normal matter, either as a swift attack or a sustained effect to keep hostile elements at bay. Creepers are known to act with intelligence and purpose, establishing traps and adapting to threats. It is suspected that the TITANs used them for facility manufacturing, infiltration, and command-and-control purposes.

Unlike other exsurgents, creepers are not created via infection, but by transmutation through contact with an existing creeper swarm. Can be invisible, like a nanoswarm, or materialize forms with refractive metamaterials, like an invisibility cloak.

Digital Exsurgent Virus,Exsurgent,"Digital strains of the Exsurgent Virus are purely information- or code- based versions of the virus. They resemble advanced computer viruses, worms, and trojans. They spread throughout the mesh, exploit holes, mimic protocols, and bypass security measures just like a skilled hacker. Digital versions of the exsurgent virus are treated as intelligent programs, using the same rules as infomorphs.

As a matter of course, this exsurgent virus will seek to access any new systems it comes into contact with, hacking in and copying a version of itself. The attack is handled as an Opposed Test, each rolling COG + INT. If the exsurgent virus wins, the target is infected and will be corrupted by the virus in 10 Action Turns, minus 1 turn per 10 full points of MoS. If the target succeeded but rolled lower than the virus, they are aware that they are slowly being taken over. This immediately causes them 1d10 points of mental stress. An infected program has only one option for defending itself before the virus takes over—shutdown and reboot. It takes the AI or infomorph 1 full Action Turn to shut down. Restarting takes 3 full Action Turns (possibly longer if the gamemaster so decides), upon which the AI or infomorph must make another Opposed COG + INT Test against the virus. If this test also fails, then the virus has already embedded itself in the AI or infomorph’s code and will continue its infection.

Dreadnought,Exhuman,"Dreadnoughts are six-legged insectoid tanks, heavily armed and armored. They serve as the shock troops of the Rortians, exhumans bent on conquering the gate network and returning to the solar system to spread their synthetic, hive-mind fascism by force. Unlike a fenrir morph, where each subsystem is typi- cally run by a separate ego coordinating with others through a hard-linked tacnet, dreadnoughts are run by a single mass mind. Each mental unit is composed of up to a dozen egos—usually exhumans, but sometimes forcibly incorporated captured egos. The psychosurgical processes required to prune, implant skills, and meld these minds to operate as a single would be considered exceptionally unethical and dangerous by most transhumans, but such is the Rortian obsession with hive-mind states.

The unique mind structure and cyberbrain architecture required to operate a dreadnought is unsuitable for transhuman minds to sleeve or hack. It’s unclear if the ego gestalt provides any tactical bene ts over traditional transhuman heavy armor or if it merely fits with the Rortians’ mad philosophy of exhumanism.

Evidence suggests Rortians deploy dreadnoughts in their assaults in the same way they do everything else: en masse. When the exhumans find a transhuman colony accessible from their home gate, they send as many dreadnoughts through as possible to establish a beachhead. If the initial assault isn’t repelled, any transhumans on the other side can expect a violent death followed by forced uploading and psychosurgical incorporation into a dreadnought’s hive mind.

Factor Guardian,Alien,"Guardians are the only Factor subspecies besides ambassadors to have had extensive contact with transhumanity. They serve as bodyguards for ambassador phenotypes outside the ship. In addition to the dust toxin wielded by the entire species, guard- ians have tentacles and the equivalent of eelware to make them more formidable in close combat. Combined with a Factor’s natural resilience to kinetic damage, these augmentations make guardians capable close- to mid-range  ghters.

The few quiet conflicts fought between the Factors and trans- humanity thus far (mostly on various exoplanets) have exclusively been fought against guardians. They may be more capable than the ambassador phenotype, but guardians still rely on the ambush tactics favored by the entire species. As their Factor dust and eelware can be rendered useless by off-the-rack vacsuits, and the creatures are vulnerable to a competent transhuman armed with energy weapons, guardians are fully aware that they don’t rank in a fair fight, and they are dangerous because they flan around that disadvantage.

Fetch,Xenofauna,"A fetch is a delta fork of a TITAN ASI, trimmed down to maneuver among transhuman mesh networks and morphs. Though exceptionally smart and capable, pruning down a superintelligence’s mind to that size is much like lobotomizing a god. Even for the TITANs, this is risky and requires  nesse. As a result, fetches can be unstable, erratic, and unpredictable, more so the longer they operate independently from their parent mind. The exsurgent virus may have additional unforeseen side effects on TITAN mind-states. Nevertheless, fetches are brilliant hackers, engineers, and tacticians, easily equal to transhumanity's best. They are clever, forward-thinking, and devious foes.

Most fetches were created for specific tasks that required direct oversight, but were too unimportant for the greater TITAN minds to attend to personally. They also managed longterm projects and situations too dangerous for direct TITAN involvement. Some continue far beyond their operational parameters, others linger on to attend to unexpected deviations. A few remain trapped or hidden within hardware, having survived the battles of the Fall, while others still operate under direct TITAN command. Transhuman opponents frequently mistake fetches for actual TITANs.

Fetches prefer infomorph forms, managing minion AIs and controlling both synthetic and biological servants via puppet socks.

Fractal,TITAN,"Fractals are advanced bush robots. In their standard form, fractals resemble a strange sort of metallic bush surrounded with an eerie glittering haze. In their center are a number of metallic branches, linked together with a exible joint. Each of these branches splits into two or more smaller branches, also with exible joints. These branches also split, and then split again, and so on down to the molecular scale. The tip of each fractal branch ends in a nanoscale manipulator. Fractals are deceptively potent adversaries, having the capability to dismantle almost anything at the molecular level, much like a disassembler nanoswarm (p. 329), and also to rebuild anything just like a nanofabricator (p. 327). Attacking them with projectiles is futile, as they absorb the ammunition, break it down into its constituent atoms or molecules, and then use those as components to build a weapon to use against you.

Fractals can be equipped with any type of gear the gamemaster desires—if they don’t have something, they can make it. Fractals are also able to nanofabricate items much more quickly than transhuman nanofabricators; reduce all times by half (half an hour per Cost category). Fractals are difficult to damage, as their “bodies” are actually airy assemblages of fractal branches. Any damaged branches that are broken off are caught and absorbed by others. Reduce damage from all standard non-area effect or spray attacks to the minimum possible damage. Area effect and spray weapons do half damage. Fractals are self-repairing, regenerating damage at the rate of 1d10 points per half hour and repairing wounds at the rate of 1 per hour after all damage is healed.

Fractal Troll,Exsurgent,"These deformed albino creatures stand roughly 2 meters tall. They lope around substrate labyrinths on elongated primate forearms, gripping the walls with massive clawed wrists and prehensile feet. Two pairs of smaller limbs—one on the back and one jutting from the chest—are equipped with fractal digits. Used as exsurgent drones for the inscrutable needs of their machine masters, fractal trolls still possess the remnants of their original egos. Some carry the shattered remnants of multiple egos merged by the TITANs.

Most fractal trolls were driven horribly insane by their ordeal. Though cryonic and inured to vacuum, the trolls still must eat to survive, choosing between feedstock cultures made from recycled transhuman corpses or cannibalism. Memory fragments clash with the brutal horror of their continued existence, causing extreme cognitive dissonance and trauma. The majority of fractal trolls killed themselves after the TITANs’ departure. Those that remain survive only through disassociation, sublimating the remains of their transhumanity into odd portraiture scratched into the walls. 

Encounters with transhumans provoke fractal trolls into flight-or-fight response. Some attack out of fear TITAN agents have returned to enslave them; others kill in the hope the TITANs will approve and return, freeing them from the horrific memories plaguing them. Those not murdered and consumed can expect painful interrogation at the fractal hands of a confused pre-Fall ego driven mad by years of pain.

Gut Eeater,Xenofauna,"Gut eaters are alien parasites that invade biological organisms and take up resi- dence in their abdomens. These parasites extend neuro laments to mesh with the host’s nervous system, taking over their mind. They express a new mouth cavity in the host’s belly to directly feed, also extruding tentacle arms to grasp food and prey.

Gut eater parasite infections have been discovered in a half dozen gatecrashers, though it is unclear how they were infected or for how long. There is no overlap in visited exoplanets among victims, suggesting the parasites are present in multiple extrasolar locations. Alternatively, they are spreading within the solar system or via gate travel.

If the host body is badly damaged, poisoned, or electrocuted, the parasite bursts forth from the abdominal cavity and seeks out a new home. This is almost assuredly lethal to the host. Gut eaters are slow and defenseless outside of their victims, so they will stick to crevices and shadows until they can assail a new victim by surprise, forcing their way down their throat.

Gut eaters have a dietary requirement: prions, a type of infectious protein, which fuel a yeast their bodies rely on. Though prions are the source of many diseases in humans and animals, gut eaters are immune to these ill effects. Gut-eater hosts are periodically manipulated into locating a source of prions. As the most available source is transhuman brains, hosts are coerced to commit murder so that the gut eater can consume the victim's head meats.

Astrobiologists believe the species is not intelligent, though it is capable of subverting and controlling transhuman minds. Aside from avoiding danger and discovery and providing food and prions, the parasite does not alter the host’s behavior. The question remains open, however, as not enough is known about the gut eater’s biology and methods of manipulation.",,,XR.115,"COG:10, COO:10, INT:20, REF:20, SAV:10, SOM:15, WIL:25, SPD:1, DUR:30",FALSE,"Climbing 50, Freerunning 30,

Head Wrapper,Exsurgent,"These exsurgents look like four-armed star sh, capable of walking like quadrupeds on their spiny limbs. Each appendage ends in thin, clawed digits useful for climbing and tool use. The arms also house sensory bands for hearing and infrared vision. The underside of the creature houses a circular mouth ringed with hooked teeth. This mouth can distend outwards like a leech, enveloping much larger prey than it might seem. Wrappers are ideally suited for microgravity habitats due to a series of vent sacs capable of significant thrust.

Wrappers derive their name from a tendency to attack from above, enveloping a transhuman's head and restraining the arms with their legs. The creatures like to band together and nest in a single location, collectively ensuring maximum casualties rather than competing with each other for prey. Lone wrappers have been known to follow other groups of exsurgents, waiting to strike until transhumans are busy engaging other threats. As such, more advanced exsurgents sometimes grow wrappers from infected body banks to leave in their wake, covering their migratory trail.

The wrapper digestive system is incapable of processing synthetics; after consuming the head of a transhuman, they pass cortical stacks and other neurological implants by defecating out of their mouths. Small, TITAN-hacked bots and other wild artificials sometimes lurk outside wrapper territory, salvaging tech from these waste piles. A preponderance of small bots waiting for implant carrion is a successful tactic for tracking the location of otherwise stealthy wrappers.

Hollow,Tech,"Hollows are a plasma colony of advanced nanobots. These mimics can replicate any biological creature by invasively mapping it, a gruesome and lethal process wherein the plasma digests the host and assumes its form. Hollows completely absorb the minds, memories, and skills of their targets—essentially becoming them.

Hollows only replicate an outer-shell “skin suit” with no internal organs, skeletal structure, or muscles. These “skins” appear real but are only a few centimeters deep. If cut or ruptured, the nanoplasma within is exposed.

Each hollow carries a node of memory diamond that acts as the “brain” and stores the host's memories. The only way to kill a hollow is to destroy this node. Heavily damaged hollows are forced into hibernation, disassembling nearby materials for repair.

The origin of hollows is a mystery even to themselves. Artifacts of a long- extinct alien species, their original programming corrupted or forgotten, they pursue their own rogue purposes. Though most of the identities they absorb are discarded after use, some are saved within the node nucleus in an intact or fragmented form.

Hookbladder,Neogenetic,"Hookbladders are an aquatic, jellyfish-like animal inhabiting the swamps of Teragula, an exoplanet being terraformed by TerraGenesis. They are named for their single hard body part, an incredibly light hook of horn-like material located near the animal’s single reproductive/digestive opening. Specimens are translucent sacs 40 centimeters in diameter, with a radial body plan and fine tentacles ending in feathery feelers.

For most of their six-year life cycle, hookbladders are no more than a nuisance to transhumans, occasionally inflicting painful hook stings on the careless. When they enter the their reproductive cycle, however, hookbladders seek out hosts. They propel themselves up to 3 meters into the air using jets of water, hook into a victim's flesh, and then envelop its head, leaving only the mouth exposed. It then compels its host to kill other animals. 

When enough corpses are collected, the hookbladder asphyxiates the host atop its victims. It then bursts, spraying thousands of eggs over the entire heap, and adding its own body to feed its young.

Iktomi Kumobot,Tech,"The seemingly-extinct arthropod-analog alien species known as the Iktomi left ruins and artifacts on dozens of gate-connected worlds. Though these ruins are thou- sands of years old, many remain surprisingly intact. In at least two instances, these sites were protected by still-functioning guardian robots, dubbed “kumobots.”

Like their creators, kumobots have a spider-like form, with six radially symmetric legs and a smaller pair of manipulative arms/claws. As a protective measure, the head retracts into the body and the legs pull in as a protective shield. The kumobot’s shape-changing features enable it to further pull into a ball for high-speed rolling. Curiously, the legs are also detachable, suggesting that perhaps Iktomi biology functioned the same.

The exact purpose of kumobots is unclear, aside from protecting Iktomi locations and technology. Though equipped with weaponry such as adjustable-strength lasers, their general utility suggests they may have served other purposes. Unfortunately, all known specimens have been destroyed.

Mantis Worm,Xenofauna,"Mantis worms are small, aquatic creatures native to the exoplanet Sacrebleu. Each adult worm is approximately 10–16 centimeters in length, with a sharp pointed head, large sensory whiskers, a pair of mantis-like forelegs, and two other pairs of legs on its torso. Their backs are covered in a set of bristly spines. Mantis worms live in large, hive-like colonies, built out of a sort of solidi ed gelatin they secrete, usually found at depths of less than 10 meters.

Mantis worms swim with an undulating motion, much like an eel, but are capable of pushing them- selves forward in short bursts at great speeds. They are carnivorous scavengers, often feeding off of corpses, but will also attack prey in great numbers. Swarms of mantis worms will propel themselves, torpedo-like, towards their victims, even attacking targets in shallow waters or near the shoreline, propelling themselves several meters out of the water. They will pierce the skin, pushing their heads inside, while grappling with their arms. They then belch out an acidic mucus inside the body that dissolves skin, organ, and muscle tissue into a sort of slurry that they feed on. This effect is quite painful. Their spines make them extremely dangerous to pull out, leaving gaping tear wounds. Attacking en masse, they can even overwhelm large creatures, who quickly succumb to the pain and numerous bite wounds. Though many mantis worms also die, their corpses become food for surviving worms. They can survive for short periods on land, skittering about on their legs.

When attacked in the water, or to defend their hives, mantis worms will secrete their mucus, creating an acidic cloud within the water that is strong enough to drive away predators. Mantis worms are immune to acid/ corrosive attacks.",,,XR.128,"COG:5, COO:20, INT:10, REF:20, SAV:1, SOM:15, WIL:5, SPD:1, DUR:50",FALSE,"Fray 40, Perception 40, Freerunning 30, Scrounging 50, Swimming 60, Unarmed Combat 60",,Walker,2/8,"Enhanced Hearing, Enhanced Smell, Poison Gland",,,,,1d10 / 2,

Neurode,Exhuman,"Neurodes seek to boot-strap themselves to new levels of consciousness. They sleeve into over-sized amorphic clusters of neuronal and epithelial cells, encased in a hard carapace shell with four legs and a pair of arms. It would be a mistake to call their genius “crude,” but their methods certainly are. Their sheer mass of cerebral tissue and neural connections makes neurodes capable of calculations far beyond a typical transhuman. Newer “brain box” designs embrace a quadruped pod design and incorporate chains of networked cyberbrains into the brain blob. Over time, the intelligence gap between neurodes and transhumans is only getting wider.

These exhumans value intelligence so far above all else that their morphs have little combat utility. Some do not even have sensory organs, relying on sensor inputs and mesh access. Confl ict with neurodes consists of combat with drones, other exhumans, and transhumans manipulated into protecting the neurode’s interests. Neurodes wield their intelligence as their primary weapon, with layer-upon-layer of deception, false leads, tactical anticipation, traps of every conceivable kind, and imaginative fail-safe options.

The extreme and reckless psychosurgery necessary for sleeving into a neurode often results in an array of mental illnesses. Neurodes are typically solitary, preferring to keep their mind enhancement secrets to themselves, but sometimes work in small teams.

Neurodes will have protection in the form of other exhumans, leftover specials, drone defenders, traps, and other NPCs.

Ny’knikiin,TITAN,"The ny’knikiin resulted from TITAN experiments in the weaponization of captured pod morphs The machines programmed simulmorphs that emulated pods and sleeved the egos of hundreds of Earth- based predators, testing to see what minds adapted to the alien bodies best. Mantis shrimp proved the most successful. The simulspace was time-accelerated further and the environment tailored to teach the shrimp to operate their new forms to full capacity. A few subjective millennia of time later and the ny’knikiin were ready for deployment.

Ny’knikiin are identified by their mutilated mouths; the lips are peeled back to reveal a constant grimace and the tongues shaved into points—a disturbing contrast to the doll-like features of most pods. The fearsome appearance is furthered by grunts and screams meant to frighten prey, but the ny’knikiin otherwise arm and equip themselves like any other transhuman headed to war. 

Their language is a mix of radio signals and pheromones, taught to them by their creators. The TITANs engineered a tense into the grammar structure called the “god scent.” Communication from the machine gods provokes a conditioned endocrine response in ny’knikiin that’s a mixture of breeding-season heat and desperate hunger.

Self-Replicating Nanoswarm,TITAN,"The nanoswarms distributed by the TITANs are a step beyond the nanotechnology available to transhumanity. Unlike transhuman-created nanoswarms, the TITAN swarms are autonomous, sapient, and self-replicating. They are also highly adaptive, meaning they are not single function but can modify themselves to perform almost any nanoswarm task. They may also nano-fabricate new materials, much like fractals (p. 383). Combined, these capabilities make these nanoswarms incredibly potent. When they encounter a new oppo- nent, they can scan the opponent’s capabilities and then fabricate offensive systems to use against them. When an opponent deploys a weapon system on the swarm, it will learn and adapt countermeasures that will make such attacks ineffective against the swarm in the future. These nanoswarms may also function like so-called utility fog, linking together into a physical lattice in order to create large-scale physical forms.

The possibilities for TITAN nanoswarms are almost limitless. For example, they may lie in wait as an invisible nanoscopic swarm, oat as barely visible mist, or shape into a swarm of small hopping drones to move about. When facing opponents, the nanoswarm could transform itself into a giant electroshock net across the ground, shape into a flotilla of seeker-armed flying drones, or link together as a set of massive whip-like tentacles to slice through their eshy foes. These nanoswarms are nearly impossible to destroy, as only a few nanobots need to survive in order to rebuild the swarm, and the new swarm will learn from the mistakes of the old.

Self-replicating nanoswarms follow the rules given for Nanoswarms and Microswarms, p. 328, with the following additions and exceptions: 

* They do not need to be sustained by a hive and do not deteriorate.  * They self-repair damage at the rate of 1d10 per half hour.  * They may nanofabricate new items, materials, or forms in half the standard timeframe (half an hour per Cost category).  * They may replicate any of the nanoswarm func- tions as noted on p. 328, as well as the functions of any other nanoswarm-using gear (smart dust, covert ops tool, repair spray, etc.).  * They may make SOM Tests.  * At the gamemaster’s discretion, they may adapt  new defenses against attacks used against them. New defenses take a minimum of 2 hours to devise and replicate throughout the swarm, after which such an attack will in ict minimal or no damage.  * Assume they have any skill they need at a minimum of 40. Such skills may rapidly improve as needed.

Shifter,Exsurgent,"Shifters are synthmorphs that have been transformed by the shifter nanoplague. The virus converts material frames into a liquid metal composed of exotic smart matter. Shapeshifting becomes possible, the material solidifying, liquefying, and reshaping according to the exsurgent’s needs. The visual mimicry can be reprogrammed in a matter of seconds and is sophisticated enough to imitate biomorphs, though touch and other wavelengths easily reveal this deception. They can reshape their shell into knives, clubs, and even complex mechanical devices such as wheels, rotors, shredders, or rearms (but not bullets).

Shifters prefer isolating and eliminating targets one-by-one, luring victims into low- security areas for execution. Once the body is disposed of, they can assume that form without fear of contradiction. While shifters are capable of impersonation, they do not acquire their victims’ ego or memories. They may not possess knowledge or skills crucial to their cover, so they rely heavily on deception and visual trickery.

Multiple shifters have been discovered before fully wiping out transhuman habitats, but they remain dangerous even when exposed. Nothing about a shifter’s design necessitates the limited anthropomorphic construction of most synthmorphs.

They were also used to create distractions, paint targets for artillery and missiles, jam radio and radar, set traps, and assault soldiers and civilians. Skitters were often deployed behind enemy lines by drones in aerogel bubbles or simply mass produced from hacked nanofabbers.

Individual skitter bots are only about 6 centimeters in length, but they are deployed in swarms of hundreds or even thousands.

Skrik,Exsurgent,"Transhumans infected with the skrik variation of the exsurgent virus do not undergo any outward physical transformations, though their minds are subverted. They do, however, undergo some interesting internal changes. On a semi-regular basis the exsurgent coughs up small creatures known as skriks. These creatures resemble tiny versions of the exsurgent’s morph, though often with minor physiological differences or mutations, such as claws, poison stingers, prehensile tails, or a single wing to maneuver in microgravity.

Most exsurgents will only cough up one skrik at a time, usually once every 2–3 days. On occasion, however, they will bring one up multiple times a day, or vomit forth multiple skriks at once. The skriks themselves are usually small when regurgitated, less than 20 centimeters, depending on the throat size of the exsurgent’s morph, though over time they will grow to 40 centimeters in length or more. They will immediately seek to hide and escape upon their “release.”

Skriks are not sapient, though they have been known to use simple tools. They are malevolent and cunning, attacking anyone other than exsurgents. When possible, they will establish a secret nest near the exsurgent, leaving pheromonal trails so that other skriks produced by the exsurgent can join up with them. Some skrik nests have been discovered with hundreds of the creatures. They prefer to attack by surprise and with safety of numbers.",,,"XR.136, MYE","COG:5, COO:15, INT:15, REF:20, SAV:5, SOM:5, WIL:10, SPD:1, DUR:5",FALSE,"Fray 60, Perception 40, Climbing 60, Free Fall 50, Freerunning 50, Unarmed Combat 60",,Walker,3/16,,Very Large Size,,,,1d10 / 2,https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/87325424/eldrich-images/creatures/Skriks_MarkMolnar.png

Slouches seem to be based on their designer’s alien physiology. They feature heavy claws on hands and feet and a turret stationed on each shoulder. They move with a long, loping gait, sometimes using leaning forward to use their arms when running or to balance for a vicious backwards kick.

The slouches encountered so far seem to be programmed to control the Pandora gates and prevent their use. They do not automatically attack anything coming through a gate, but they are know to set up automatic defenses and traps that do so. Automated drones in particular will have their tethers cut and be targeted before they can conduct detailed scans. They will, however, prevent anything that comes through from using that gate again. They have been known to track gatecrashing teams away from the gate and ambush them elsewhere. Slouches are also known to sometimes carry tools and engage in attempts to unearth and salvage alien technology.

It is unknown if slouches are controlled remotely or by an onboard AI. To date, they have self-destructed to prevent forensic examination.",,,XR.137,"COG:20, COO:20, INT:15, REF:30, SAV:10, SOM:25, WIL:20, SPD: 1, DUR:70",TRUE,"Fray 55, Perception 60, Beam Weapons 70, Demolitions 60, Free Fall 50, Freerunning 70, Hardware: Electronics 50, Hardware: Robotics 60, Infiltration 65, Kinetic Weapons 40, Unarmed Combat 60",26/20,Walker,4/24,"Enhanced Hearing, Enhanced Vision, Neurachem (Level 1), Radar, Radiation Sense, Specialized Hive: Fixers, T-Ray Emitter",,,"Blue Box Gate Control Unit, Disassembly Tools, Engineer Nanoswarm, Fabber, Scout Nanoswarm, Superthermite Charge",,,https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/87325424/eldrich-images/creatures/AlienRobot_RadialStudio.png

Snapper,TITAN,"At least one variant of the exsurgent virus explicitly targets synthmorphs, bots, and vehicles. The nanoplague physically breaks these machines down, combines them with other machines, and transforms them into centipede-like monstrosities known as snappers.

The chassis of a snapper is usually adapted from large shells or vehicles. The frame is a hollow hexagonal tube composed of hinged segments that allow it to contort like the body of a snake. Multiple sets of limbs line three sides of the tube, set radially at 120-degree increments. The limbs are heavy, double- jointed, and articulated with three joints. Each ends in either a triad of manipulator digits or a pincer resembling a giant, three-pronged scissor.

Snapper movement is as perplexing as it is terrifying to behold. The synths tech-ically “walk” on their limbs, but they do so in an unpredictable, rolling gait, seeming to stumble or “fall up” wherever they go. Their bizarre movement, large size, thick armor, and giant pincers make snappers formidable opponents.

A digital version of this exovirus strain is also known to target and infect minifac and large-scale fabrication facilities. In the Fall, snappers were typically deployed in areas where the TITANs seized control of crude factories without the exotic matter necessary to craft sophisticated weaponry. A favorite tactic was to send snappers after clustered crowds of transhumans awaiting farcasting or evacuation. The speed and efficiency with which they could be assembled made them a favorite harassment tactic, occupying defense forces until more sophisticated exsurgents could arrive. Too often, the snappers were enough to finish the job, rolling through and dismembering panicked crowds with abandon.",,,XR.139,"COG:20, COO:30, INT:20, REF:30, SAV:20, SOM:35, WIL:30, SPD:1, DUR:70",FALSE,"Fray 60, Perception 40, Climbing 65, Free Fall 60, Freerunning 60, Infiltration 50, Intimidation 70, Kinetic Weapons 65, Unarmed Combat 55 (Pincers)",16/16,Roller,6/40,"360-Degree Vision, Enhanced Vision, Lidar, Magnetic System, Neurachem, Structural Enhancement","Ambidexterity: x4, Large Size",,,,1d10,https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/87325424/eldrich-images/creatures/Snapper_QuinnSimoes.png

Their pair of arms are ridged with vicious-looking serrations and spikes, which they use for murderous purposes. A set of retractable tentacle-chains also deploy from the torso, used as prehensile limbs and for whip-like attacks.

The TITANs wielded stalkers as assassins and elite tactical squads. They were ideal for surgical strikes that required highly competent killing machines able to move in stealth and infiltrate transhuman buildings.

Though they often carry traditional weaponry, stalkers have two built-in systems that deserve special note. When surrounded by enemies in close quarters, stalkers are known to spin their entire torsos at high speeds, whipping their tentacle chains around them in lethal, amputating arcs.

Stinger Hound,Xenofauna,"Stinger hounds are native to the exoplanet Wenguang. Despite being a promising colony site and hosting xenoarcheological discoveries, transhumans have had a difficult time on Wenguang in large part due to the heavy presence of stinger hound packs.

Stinger hounds are carnivorous quadrupeds with elongated, clawed forelimbs, providing a rapid, loping, ground-covering gait. A light, hard shell protects their back, its colors and contours matching the rocks and jagged leaves of local ora. Huddled under their shells, in a dug out shallow depression, the hounds blend right in, until they launch their ambush.

Stinger hounds are named for the bulbous stinger that tips the end of an impressively long tongue. The hounds close in on their prey and expel the stinger from their mouths, injecting a potent venom that inevitably slows down and paralyzes the dangerous creatures the hounds prefer to feed on.

By some strange quirk of biology, many transhumans seem to give off a pheromonal scent that is remarkably similar to that exuded by stinger hounds' favorite prey animals. This has led to an exceptionally high instance of stinger hound packs attacking explorers, researchers, and colonists. Stinger hounds have even gone so far as to chase down and attack drones and vehicles, doing serious damage with their claws.",,,XR.141,"COG 10, COO:20, INT:15, REF:20, SAV:5, SOM:20, WIL:10, SPD:1, DUR:40",FALSE,"Fray 55, Perception 60, Exotic Melee Weapon: Tongue Stinger 65, Freerunning 75, Infiltration 60, Intimidation 40, Unarmed Combat 60 (Pounce)",15/12,Walker,5/44,"Carapace Armor, Enhanced Hearing, Enhanced Smell, Enhanced Vision, Poison Gland",,,,,1d10 / 2,https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/87325424/eldrich-images/creatures/StingerHound_LieSetiawan.png

These provide the predator with astonishing aerial capabilities, from hovering and swooping to fast diving attacks.

The two forelimbs of the switchwing end in massive four-clawed pincers. These are ideal for snatching small prey animals off the ground but can also take chunks out of larger victims. A smaller set of mandibles is used for biting. Females of the species are also equipped with a nasty venomous stinger.

TITAN Smart Mine,TITAN,"Most transhumans wish the existence of smart mines could be blamed on the TITANs. Sadly, smart mines were used in warfare long before the Fall. Though outlawed by every treaty and convention of warfare, smart mines were frequently deployed against civilian populations. The TITANs merely enhanced the design.

Smart mines are roughly 3 decimeters long and move on spider- like thin robotic legs. Their frame holds a compact sensor package and a payload of volate chemicals stored in interconnected sacs, housed underneath a cheap plastic shell that doubles as shrapnel.

Smart mines maximize their resource-to-kill ratio. Deployed in packs, they coordinate ambushes on isolated targets. Their morph and armor recognition software calculates their payloads exact- ingly; their aim is to cripple and disable, not kill a target outright. Attacking en masse, when one of the bots manages to crawl onto a leg or arm (or similar crucial limb), it jettisons its extra chemical explosives (save those deemed necessary for the attack) for the others to pick up, mixes the volatile sacs together, and explodes in a shaped charge. Those injured by smart mines suffer amputation, burns, and smaller shrapnel wounds. Once a target is disabled, the remainder of the pack injects specialized medichines to cauterize wounds and prolong the victim’s suffering, then retreat and wait for the victim to call for help. They are known to torture those too stubborn to lure their comrades into a trap. Anyone attempting to help the wounded suffers the same ambush. The last mine in the pack will detonate all of its remaining charges.

Surviving TITAN smart mines are exceptionally careful. As kamikazes, they must ration their numbers to inflict maximum casualties. Some swarms on Earth, Luna, Mars, and abandoned orbital weapons factories still have corrupted fabricators pumping out reinforcements. Entire areas are no-man’s-lands with dozens of spider bombs waiting under every pile of rubble.",,,XR.138,"COG:15, COO:20, INT:15, REF:15, SAV:10, SOM:10, WIL:15, INT:5, SPD:1, DUR:20",TRUE,"Fray 50, Demolitions 80, Free Fall 40,

Veiled Leech,Xenofauna,"Veiled leeches are arboreal creatures from the exoplanet Plootarg. These hematophages subsist on blood and bodily fluids. Veiled leeches are smaller in size and build than a neo-chimpanzee. Their elongated skulls end in a collection of tentacles they use to latch on and suck blood from from their prey. Their six eyes can see in infrared, to spot the location of major blood vessels under the skin. Membranes stretch between their limbs, enabling them to glide between trees in Plootarg’s low gravity and quietly pounce on the backs of their victims.

The most unique feature of veiled leeches is their ability to turn invisible at will. Their skin and gliding membranes have an amazing negative-index metamaterial array, enabling them to bend light waves around themselves, much like an invisibility cloak. This can be triggered as desired, giving veiled leeches a strong advantage when hiding from predators or sneaking up on prey. Astrobiologists are currently studying if this occurred naturally or if veiled leeches (or their ancestors) were modified by an unknown intelligence.

The sucker bite of these leeches’ mouth tentacles injects a toxin that either knocks their prey unconscious or makes them lethargic and docile. Veiled leeches do not usually feed enough to kill the victim, though a pack of leeches together might.

If caught in free fall, they cough up a convulsive spit that is just strong enough to drift them towards the nearest surface.

Void crawlers feed on abundant bioluminescent fungal growths. They can survive in low-oxygen environments (and even vacuum for hours), are radiation resistant, and can hibernate for weeks. Void crawlers build elaborate warrens in open spaces out of their own hardened excrement. These nests extend for kilometers and are cluttered with objects the void crawlers have collected.

Oddly, void crawlers are infected with a variant of the Watts-MacLeod exovirus, giving them async abilities. They remain close together to stay mindlinked, and their packs are surprisingly coordinated in their efforts.

Wastewalker,Exsurgent,"Smooth white masks, floating out of shadows and flame, looking inexplicably hungry through doll’s eyes and expressionless dashes of mouths—the wastewalkers on the march were the last sight of many transhumans. These exsurgent cyborgs were employed by the TITANs as elite infantry during the Fall. Wastewalkers are intelligent and tactically minded, and they frequently commanded other exsurgents and TITAN puppets as shock troops, indirect  re spotters, and cannon fodder.

The masks themselves are the infection vector. Wastewalkers (or other TITAN minions) restrain captured biomorphs and force them to wear the mask until it melds to the face, beginning the transformation. Incorporation into the wastewalker social structure takes place within the hour, and the new exsurgent begins following orders from the tribe’s alpha. The victim grows tall and wiry over the course of days: the virus stretching and perverting the joints of the fingers, arms, and legs. Claws extrude from the nails and elbows, poking out of the featureless black polymer armor that slowly replaces the skin. Thin cylinders protrude from a hump on the back, each housing a hive of fabricator or disassembler nanoswarms. Excess body mass from the transformation moves to the hump and is used as feedstock. No one has ever successfully recovered an ego from a biomorph infected with the wastewalker strain.

Since the departure of the TITANs, feral wastewalkers look to their tribe’s alpha for orders. They communicate in bursts of encrypted digital static.

Whippers are the result of biomorphs transformed by a biological strain of the xenomorph virus, though TITAN machines and other exsurgent have also been known to mass-produce whippers from corrupted healing vats. Their lack of armor and small stature means they ambush victims in large numbers and avoid open conflict with armed foes whenever possible. Whippers were primarily used in the Fall against evacuating transhuman civilians. Dozens of whippers would herd and contain fleeing refugees, driving panicked crowds closer and closer together until the tentacle whips could eviscerate multiple targets in a single swipe.

Whippers are sometimes known to use tools and weapons. Several variations have also been spotted, including more heavily armored ones deployed in vacuum.",,,XR.150,"COG:20, COO:30, INT:20, REF:30, SAV:15, SOM:25, WIL:20, SPD:1, DUR:35",FALSE,"Fray 50, Perception 50, Beam Weapons 40, Climbing 40, Free Fall 40, Freerunning 50, Infiltration 50, Intimidation 50, Kinetic Weapons 40, Unarmed Combat 45 (Tentacles)",,Walker,8/40,"Enhanced Vision, Neurachem (Level 1)",,,,,1d10,
Whiplash,Xenofauna,"Found on the exoplanet Sunrise, the whiplash expresses both plant and animal features. An arboreal carnivore, the whiplash moves among tree trunk and branches using its grasping roots, seeking out the best place to ambush prey. It extends a sap-covered vine from its mouth, extending up to 4 meters, which draws critters attracted to its sweet scent. The sap is extremely sticky, and once a creature is caught against the feeding tendril, it quickly entangles them and rolls them up to the whiplash’s waiting maw above. Trapped victims are swallowed into an acid-filled digestive sac that slowly dissolves them.

Whiplashes primarily feed on small plant-mammals and the local bird analogs, but larger and older whiplashes are capable of catching and eating transhumans and similar-sized creatures. Whiplashes are not smart enough to distinguish synthmorphs and bots as non-prey; they will grab anything that brushes against their feeding tendril and spit out whatever they can’t digest a few days later.

Several subspecies of whiplash exist, including ones with a clawed tendril and another that prefer to repeatedly pull up and drop their victims to the ground, tenderizing them before eating.",,,XR.149,"COG:1, COO:15, INT:10, REF:20, SV:5, SOM:20, WIL:5, SPD:1, DUR:35",FALSE,"Climbing 50, Infiltration 50, Unarmed Combat 40 (Subdual), Fray 20, Perception 40",,Walker,4/16,Chameleon Skin,,,,,1d10 / 2,https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/87325424/eldrich-images/creatures/Whiplash_AustenMengler.png
Wild Artificial Collector,Tech,"These wild artificials (p. 151) are small, agile, cat-sized bots programmed with animal behaviors for scavenging and hoarding. They scurry on spider-like legs across any available surface, collecting small objects that strike their interest.

Wild Artificial Loper,Tech,"The booming hacker lab culture on Mars inspires experimentation with robotic shells and non-standard, low-level AIs. The AIs range from animal mind imprints and “uplifted” complex systems to non-human mindsets and the artistic, weird, and at-out bizarre. Some projects lead to interesting results and even breakthroughs in ALI development; many more are hindered by improper program- ming and a lack of understanding of non-human mind-state implementation; quite a few are simply disasters.

A significant number of these experiments escape, are abandoned, or are intentionally set free. A booming population of wild artificials now haunts the Martian wilderness and dome-city back alleys. These feral bots form animal-like packs, claim territory, and even hunt and compete with Martian wildlife or other wild bots.

Xenosampler,Tech,"Xenosamplers are AI-piloted drones send out by an unknown alien species to explore exoplanets via the Pandora gate network, collect samples of alien life, and return home. For reasons unknown, these xenosamplers are unable to find their way back. Perhaps the gate connections no longer work, perhaps they were damaged or lost their memories, or perhaps the civilization that created them no longer exists.

Xenosamplers are maneuverable thrust-vector flyers, often ranging considerably far from the nearest Pandora gate in search of life. They use a variety of tools to observe and take samples, up to and including stunning creatures with an electro-laser. Some have been known to set non-lethal traps to capture subjects for sampling and study.

Xenosamplers are not particularly hostile—they simply wish to gather their samples and move on. They are wary around sapient life. If presented with overwhelming firepower or hostility, they will flee. 
Though xenosamplers sometimes work in small groups, they are typically found alone. Firewall is not yet aware of xenosamplers, though there has been at least one hostile encounter between xenosamplers and hypercorp gatecrashing teams.

Xenosamplers may be incredibly old, damaged, and/or malfunctioning.

Zephyr,Xenofauna,"Zephyrs are unusual predators discovered living in the upper layers of a gas giant’s atmosphere. It is strongly suspected that zephyrs were genetically engineered and seeded along with numerous other species to create a unique ecosystem on the exoplanet Fata Morgana by an unknown civilization. Zephyrs are the apex predators of this environment, feeding on the balloon creatures and jelly-like oaters that drift among the haze and storm banks.

Though whale-sized, zephyrs have massive gas-filled bladders that keep them a oat in denser atmosphere and powerful wings for maneuverability. Sophisticated biological nanobots repair radiation damage and keep their gas bladders filled.

Zombie Crab,Xenofauna,"Zombie crabs are arthropods found on the exoplanet Droplet. Very similar in body plan to the crabs of Earth, zombie crabs are significantly larger and spikier. They are carnivorous and not particularly intelligent.

Zombie crabs are so named because they spread a toxoplasma-related protist pathogen that affects the behavior of those infected. Zombie crabs are nocturnal and hunt prey at night, and they are quite skilled at moving quietly along the surf and shore to ambush victims. Not all of their targets are killed and eaten, 
however—some are deliberately wounded but kept alive, infected with the protists. The pathogen usually spreads quickly throughout the host. They then become infectious, spreading the disease to others. Over the course of a week, the infection drives up their temperature and hobbles their higher brain functions, causing them to seek out a cooling mechanism—usually water. The desired effect is to lure the victims out to the ocean, where they either drown or are dragged under the waves for a zombie crab feast.",,,XR.154,"COG:1, COO:10, INT:5, REF:10, SAV:5, SOM:20, WIL:5, SPD:1, DUR:50",FALSE,"Fray 30, Perception 35, Climbing 30, Freerunning 40, Infiltration 60, Intimidation 50, Scrounging 60, Swimming 40, Unarmed Combat 50",12/12,Walker,4/20,"Gills, Temperature Tolerance, Caraprace Armor",Large Size,,,,1d10 / 2,https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/87325424/eldrich-images/creatures/ZombieCrab_AustenMengler.png
