Aquarium Pet,Smart Animal,"Not so much a pet as a prison, aquarium pets are transgenic aquarium animals such as koi, plecos, or axolotls that have been implanted with a ghostrider module. The ghostrider module has no control over the animal’s body but is fully wired into its sensorium as if it were living a real-time XP recording. An ego “sleeved” into an aquarium pet experiences being a  sh, from the sensation of swimming to autonomic drives such as hunger and urination. Many of these sensations, such as the pleco’s rasping at the soft aquarium wood to which it clings with its sucker-like mouth or the koi’s constant ri ing of  lthy bottom gravel with its mouth, are deeply revolting to most transhumans. In addition, the animals used often have good hearing, meaning the sleeved ego can make out conversations outside the tank.

Aquarium pets are physically helpless, as the ego cannot control the animal. The animal behaves instinctively, avoiding nets with a Fray skill of 40 in water, flopping around helplessly out of it. The ghostrider module imposes no modifiers to the ego’s mental stats and is usually connected to a cortical stack, but it has no access to control interfaces.

Egos unwillingly placed into an aquarium pet must make a WIL x 2 Test when rst “sleeved” and every week thereafter. The ego takes 1d10 SV on a failed test. If the aquarium pet dies with the ego in it, the ghostrider module ceases running and may only be re-instanced from the cortical stack (if any). Most aquarium pets have a DUR of 1 or 2. The ghostrider module and stack take up enough space in these creatures that an observer who makes an Academics (Biology) Test or a Perception Test at –20 realizes the animal contains implants, though they won’t know what kind of implants.

Blister Beast,Xenofauna,"A neo-chimp-sized arboreal predator species from the exoplanet Echo IV, blister beasts typically work in small groups. They lurk in the local tree analogs, moving about with impressive leaps and climbing ability. When attacking, they will drop on their prey and inflict a venomous sting or bat them out of the trees with vicious tail paddle strikes. Blister beasts are highly territorial and known to aggressively assault intruders.

Blister beasts evolved the namesake defensive mechanism as a protection from other predators. Their skin is mottled with dozens of pressurized pustules that explosively burst open when they are physically attacked, releasing a spray of noxious neurotoxin goop and a lingering caustic cloud.

Blister beasts can horizontally jump 6 meters (running)/2 meters (standing) and vertically jump 2 meters; +1/0.25/0.25 meters (respectively) per 10 MoS on as Freerunning Test.

Causapod,Neogenetic,"Causapods are an interesting example of successful genetic design gone awry. The original causapod was the winner of a Tharsis League contest to create a new neogenetic creature—a new life form created from scratch (or at least with a minimum threshold of original design; a certain degree of chimerical traits were allowed) and adapted for Mars. Best described as “land octopi,” causapods are multi-limbed, with 4 primary limbs and 6 smaller ones under their mantle. They can skitter along quickly and rapidly climb surfaces they can dig their spikes into. They feature strong jaws which they can use for scooping up lizards or digging up worms, both found in areas with abundant Martian fauna. Breathing vents enable them to survive in the Martian atmosphere, and adaptive coloration provides camouflage among the rocks and soil.

As the contest winner, the causapod’s neogenetic templates were open-sourced. Unexpectedly, the creature’s look became a major hit on the mesh, popularized with “mandibular crawdiddy” memes. This spurred intense interest from various biohacker circles, who quickly ran amok with the open-source designs. Hundreds of variants were genehacked together, many with absurd or dangerous traits: phosphorescent, chittering, slick, acid-spitting, armored/spiked, and even exploding. Anon-affiliated biohackers released some of these dangerous variants for real-life griefing purposes, including harassment of metacelebrities and interference with Consortium development plans.

Chrysacid Limb,Exsurgent,"In the third stage of infection, chrysacid spurs grow and elongate into limbs, sometimes up to 2 meters in length. Though still attached to whatever they have sprouted from, they are capable of autonomous movement and possess photosensitive cells to “see” and detect movement. They attack by slicing their targets or grabbing and pinching. The exsurgent victims—reduced to pure animal instinct—attack anything they see along with their new appendages. As the limbs grow, the victims become less vehicle and more passenger as their own movement becomes impaired and they are dragged about by the sprawling, chitinous limbs.

Creeper,Exsurgent,"Creepers are amorphous clouds of small, black bubbles that spread across and destroy nearly everything they touch, converting all matter into additional creeper mass. Even under enhanced vision and multiple wavelengths, creepers appear out-of-focus and ill-defined due a visual refraction effect. Firewall operates under the theory that creepers are autonomous femtobot swarms, designed by the TITANs as an area-denial weapon and programmed to disassemble everything at the atomic level. Like TITAN nanoswarms, creepers have the capability to manufacture materials and items, including weapons, gases, and mechanical traps, but because they work at an even smaller level they can temporarily create advanced materials with superconducting, supercomputing, superdense, or even invisible properties, among others. These materials are theorized to be constructed from degenerate matter or strange matter fluids, somehow kept stable at standard gravities. Creeper temperatures remain at about 45 C regardless of activity.

Though creeper clouds move slowly, crawling or floating, they sometimes construct mobility systems enabling faster movement. They can penetrate almost any material in a short amount of time, interface with electronics and implants, and convert a standard morph in a matter of minutes. They can transform into a strange matter mass that has a repulsive effect on normal matter, either as a swift attack or a sustained effect to keep hostile elements at bay. Creepers are known to act with intelligence and purpose, establishing traps and adapting to threats. It is suspected that the TITANs used them for facility manufacturing, infiltration, and command-and-control purposes.

Unlike other exsurgents, creepers are not created via infection, but by transmutation through contact with an existing creeper swarm. Can be invisible, like a nanoswarm, or materialize forms with refractive metamaterials, like an invisibility cloak.

Digital Exsurgent Virus,Exsurgent,"Digital strains of the Exsurgent Virus are purely information- or code- based versions of the virus. They resemble advanced computer viruses, worms, and trojans. They spread throughout the mesh, exploit holes, mimic protocols, and bypass security measures just like a skilled hacker. Digital versions of the exsurgent virus are treated as intelligent programs, using the same rules as infomorphs.

As a matter of course, this exsurgent virus will seek to access any new systems it comes into contact with, hacking in and copying a version of itself. The attack is handled as an Opposed Test, each rolling COG + INT. If the exsurgent virus wins, the target is infected and will be corrupted by the virus in 10 Action Turns, minus 1 turn per 10 full points of MoS. If the target succeeded but rolled lower than the virus, they are aware that they are slowly being taken over. This immediately causes them 1d10 points of mental stress. An infected program has only one option for defending itself before the virus takes over—shutdown and reboot. It takes the AI or infomorph 1 full Action Turn to shut down. Restarting takes 3 full Action Turns (possibly longer if the gamemaster so decides), upon which the AI or infomorph must make another Opposed COG + INT Test against the virus. If this test also fails, then the virus has already embedded itself in the AI or infomorph’s code and will continue its infection.

Dreadnought,Exhuman,"Dreadnoughts are six-legged insectoid tanks, heavily armed and armored. They serve as the shock troops of the Rortians, exhumans bent on conquering the gate network and returning to the solar system to spread their synthetic, hive-mind fascism by force. Unlike a fenrir morph, where each subsystem is typi- cally run by a separate ego coordinating with others through a hard-linked tacnet, dreadnoughts are run by a single mass mind. Each mental unit is composed of up to a dozen egos—usually exhumans, but sometimes forcibly incorporated captured egos. The psychosurgical processes required to prune, implant skills, and meld these minds to operate as a single would be considered exceptionally unethical and dangerous by most transhumans, but such is the Rortian obsession with hive-mind states.

The unique mind structure and cyberbrain architecture required to operate a dreadnought is unsuitable for transhuman minds to sleeve or hack. It’s unclear if the ego gestalt provides any tactical bene ts over traditional transhuman heavy armor or if it merely fits with the Rortians’ mad philosophy of exhumanism.

Evidence suggests Rortians deploy dreadnoughts in their assaults in the same way they do everything else: en masse. When the exhumans find a transhuman colony accessible from their home gate, they send as many dreadnoughts through as possible to establish a beachhead. If the initial assault isn’t repelled, any transhumans on the other side can expect a violent death followed by forced uploading and psychosurgical incorporation into a dreadnought’s hive mind.

Ambassador are cagey, even by Factor standards. Their sole purpose is to dissemble, delay, and trick transhumans into asymmetrical exchanges of information, concealing the colony’s motivations while acquiring as much transhuman technology as possible. Factors evolved practical intelligence for trapping larger, dangerous prey. The trickster mindset responsible for their survival has never left the species, growing more sophisticated over centuries.

Transhumanity has never witnessed a gestalt. Gestalts take the form of giant slime molds, their size based on the number of available Factors and the threat presented.

Factor Guardian,Alien,"Guardians are the only Factor subspecies besides ambassadors to have had extensive contact with transhumanity. They serve as bodyguards for ambassador phenotypes outside the ship. In addition to the dust toxin wielded by the entire species, guard- ians have tentacles and the equivalent of eelware to make them more formidable in close combat. Combined with a Factor’s natural resilience to kinetic damage, these augmentations make guardians capable close- to mid-range  ghters.

The few quiet conflicts fought between the Factors and trans- humanity thus far (mostly on various exoplanets) have exclusively been fought against guardians. They may be more capable than the ambassador phenotype, but guardians still rely on the ambush tactics favored by the entire species. As their Factor dust and eelware can be rendered useless by off-the-rack vacsuits, and the creatures are vulnerable to a competent transhuman armed with energy weapons, guardians are fully aware that they don’t rank in a fair fight, and they are dangerous because they flan around that disadvantage.

Fetch,Xenofauna,"A fetch is a delta fork of a TITAN ASI, trimmed down to maneuver among transhuman mesh networks and morphs. Though exceptionally smart and capable, pruning down a superintelligence’s mind to that size is much like lobotomizing a god. Even for the TITANs, this is risky and requires  nesse. As a result, fetches can be unstable, erratic, and unpredictable, more so the longer they operate independently from their parent mind. The exsurgent virus may have additional unforeseen side effects on TITAN mind-states. Nevertheless, fetches are brilliant hackers, engineers, and tacticians, easily equal to transhumanity's best. They are clever, forward-thinking, and devious foes.

Most fetches were created for specific tasks that required direct oversight, but were too unimportant for the greater TITAN minds to attend to personally. They also managed longterm projects and situations too dangerous for direct TITAN involvement. Some continue far beyond their operational parameters, others linger on to attend to unexpected deviations. A few remain trapped or hidden within hardware, having survived the battles of the Fall, while others still operate under direct TITAN command. Transhuman opponents frequently mistake fetches for actual TITANs.

Fetches prefer infomorph forms, managing minion AIs and controlling both synthetic and biological servants via puppet socks.

These branches also split, and then split again, and so on down to the molecular scale. The tip of each fractal branch ends in a nanoscale manipulator. Fractals are deceptively potent adversaries, having the capability to dismantle almost anything at the molecular level, much like a disassembler nanoswarm (p. 329), and also to rebuild anything just like a nanofabricator (p. 327). Attacking them with projectiles is futile, as they absorb the ammunition, break it down into its constituent atoms or molecules, and then use those as components to build a weapon to use against you.

Fractals can be equipped with any type of gear the gamemaster desires—if they don’t have something, they can make it. Fractals are also able to nanofabricate items much more quickly than transhuman nanofabricators; reduce all times by half (half an hour per Cost category). Fractals are difficult to damage, as their “bodies” are actually airy assemblages of fractal branches. Any damaged branches that are broken off are caught and absorbed by others. Reduce damage from all standard non-area effect or spray attacks to the minimum possible damage. Area effect and spray weapons do half damage. Fractals are self-repairing, regenerating damage at the rate of 1d10 points per half hour and repairing wounds at the rate of 1 per hour after all damage is healed.

Fractal Troll,Exsurgent,"These deformed albino creatures stand roughly 2 meters tall. They lope around substrate labyrinths on elongated primate forearms, gripping the walls with massive clawed wrists and prehensile feet. Two pairs of smaller limbs—one on the back and one jutting from the chest—are equipped with fractal digits. Used as exsurgent drones for the inscrutable needs of their machine masters, fractal trolls still possess the remnants of their original egos. Some carry the shattered remnants of multiple egos merged by the TITANs.

Most fractal trolls were driven horribly insane by their ordeal. Though cryonic and inured to vacuum, the trolls still must eat to survive, choosing between feedstock cultures made from recycled transhuman corpses or cannibalism. Memory fragments clash with the brutal horror of their continued existence, causing extreme cognitive dissonance and trauma. The majority of fractal trolls killed themselves after the TITANs’ departure. Those that remain survive only through disassociation, sublimating the remains of their transhumanity into odd portraiture scratched into the walls. 

Encounters with transhumans provoke fractal trolls into flight-or-fight response. Some attack out of fear TITAN agents have returned to enslave them; others kill in the hope the TITANs will approve and return, freeing them from the horrific memories plaguing them. Those not murdered and consumed can expect painful interrogation at the fractal hands of a confused pre-Fall ego driven mad by years of pain.

Gut Eeater,Xenofauna,"Gut eaters are alien parasites that invade biological organisms and take up resi- dence in their abdomens. These parasites extend neuro laments to mesh with the host’s nervous system, taking over their mind. They express a new mouth cavity in the host’s belly to directly feed, also extruding tentacle arms to grasp food and prey.

Gut eater parasite infections have been discovered in a half dozen gatecrashers, though it is unclear how they were infected or for how long. There is no overlap in visited exoplanets among victims, suggesting the parasites are present in multiple extrasolar locations. Alternatively, they are spreading within the solar system or via gate travel.

If the host body is badly damaged, poisoned, or electrocuted, the parasite bursts forth from the abdominal cavity and seeks out a new home. This is almost assuredly lethal to the host. Gut eaters are slow and defenseless outside of their victims, so they will stick to crevices and shadows until they can assail a new victim by surprise, forcing their way down their throat.

Gut eaters have a dietary requirement: prions, a type of infectious protein, which fuel a yeast their bodies rely on. Though prions are the source of many diseases in humans and animals, gut eaters are immune to these ill effects. Gut-eater hosts are periodically manipulated into locating a source of prions. As the most available source is transhuman brains, hosts are coerced to commit murder so that the gut eater can consume the victim's head meats.

Astrobiologists believe the species is not intelligent, though it is capable of subverting and controlling transhuman minds. Aside from avoiding danger and discovery and providing food and prions, the parasite does not alter the host’s behavior. The question remains open, however, as not enough is known about the gut eater’s biology and methods of manipulation.",,,XR.115,"COG:10, COO:10, INT:20, REF:20, SAV:10, SOM:15, WIL:25, SPD:1, DUR:30",FALSE,"Climbing 50, Freerunning 30,

Hollow,Tech,"Hollows are a plasma colony of advanced nanobots. These mimics can replicate any biological creature by invasively mapping it, a gruesome and lethal process wherein the plasma digests the host and assumes its form. Hollows completely absorb the minds, memories, and skills of their targets—essentially becoming them.

Hollows only replicate an outer-shell “skin suit” with no internal organs, skeletal structure, or muscles. These “skins” appear real but are only a few centimeters deep. If cut or ruptured, the nanoplasma within is exposed.

Each hollow carries a node of memory diamond that acts as the “brain” and stores the host's memories. The only way to kill a hollow is to destroy this node. Heavily damaged hollows are forced into hibernation, disassembling nearby materials for repair.

The origin of hollows is a mystery even to themselves. Artifacts of a long- extinct alien species, their original programming corrupted or forgotten, they pursue their own rogue purposes. Though most of the identities they absorb are discarded after use, some are saved within the node nucleus in an intact or fragmented form. The core “ego” of each hollow may no longer exist, replaced by a discordant amalgamation of the alien minds they have consumed over time.",,,XR.117,"COG:30, COO:5, INT:10, REF:5, SAV:5, SOM:15, WIL:20, SPD:1, DUR:80",FALSE,"Climbing 50, Deception 60,

Hookbladder,Neogenetic,"Hookbladders are an aquatic, jellyfish-like animal inhabiting the swamps of Teragula, an exoplanet being terraformed by TerraGenesis. They are named for their single hard body part, an incredibly light hook of horn-like material located near the animal’s single reproductive/digestive opening. Specimens are translucent sacs 40 centimeters in diameter, with a radial body plan and fine tentacles ending in feathery feelers.

For most of their six-year life cycle, hookbladders are no more than a nuisance to transhumans, occasionally inflicting painful hook stings on the careless. When they enter the their reproductive cycle, however, hookbladders seek out hosts. They propel themselves up to 3 meters into the air using jets of water, hook into a victim's flesh, and then envelop its head, leaving only the mouth exposed. It then compels its host to kill other animals. 

When enough corpses are collected, the hookbladder asphyxiates the host atop its victims. It then bursts, spraying thousands of eggs over the entire heap, and adding its own body to feed its young. The larvae hatch within hours, gorging for days before dropping into the water to begin the aquatic part of their life cycle.",,,XR.118,"COG:1, COO:20, INT:25, REF:25, SAV:1, SOM:20, WIL:1, SPD:1, DUR:15",FALSE,"Exotic Melee Weapon: Envelope Head 65, Infiltration 70, Swimming 80, Fray 50, Perception 60",2/2,Swim,8/32/32,Enhanced Respiration,"Enhanced Respiration, Shock Immunity, Pain Tolerance (Level 2)",,,,1d10 when attacking

Iktomi Kumobot,Tech,"The seemingly-extinct arthropod-analog alien species known as the Iktomi left ruins and artifacts on dozens of gate-connected worlds. Though these ruins are thou- sands of years old, many remain surprisingly intact. In at least two instances, these sites were protected by still-functioning guardian robots, dubbed “kumobots.”

Like their creators, kumobots have a spider-like form, with six radially symmetric legs and a smaller pair of manipulative arms/claws. As a protective measure, the head retracts into the body and the legs pull in as a protective shield. The kumobot’s shape-changing features enable it to further pull into a ball for high-speed rolling. Curiously, the legs are also detachable, suggesting that perhaps Iktomi biology functioned the same.

The exact purpose of kumobots is unclear, aside from protecting Iktomi locations and technology. Though equipped with weaponry such as adjustable-strength lasers, their general utility suggests they may have served other purposes. Unfortunately, all known specimens have been destroyed.

A few subjective millennia of time later and the ny’knikiin were ready for deployment.

Ny’knikiin are identified by their mutilated mouths; the lips are peeled back to reveal a constant grimace and the tongues shaved into points—a disturbing contrast to the doll-like features of most pods. The fearsome appearance is furthered by grunts and screams meant to frighten prey, but the ny’knikiin otherwise arm and equip themselves like any other transhuman headed to war. 

Their language is a mix of radio signals and pheromones, taught to them by their creators.

Self-Replicating Nanoswarm,TITAN,"The nanoswarms distributed by the TITANs are a step beyond the nanotechnology available to transhumanity. Unlike transhuman-created nanoswarms, the TITAN swarms are autonomous, sapient, and self-replicating. They are also highly adaptive, meaning they are not single function but can modify themselves to perform almost any nanoswarm task. They may also nano-fabricate new materials, much like fractals (p. 383). Combined, these capabilities make these nanoswarms incredibly potent. When they encounter a new oppo- nent, they can scan the opponent’s capabilities and then fabricate offensive systems to use against them. When an opponent deploys a weapon system on the swarm, it will learn and adapt countermeasures that will make such attacks ineffective against the swarm in the future. These nanoswarms may also function like so-called utility fog, linking together into a physical lattice in order to create large-scale physical forms.

The possibilities for TITAN nanoswarms are almost limitless. For example, they may lie in wait as an invisible nanoscopic swarm, oat as barely visible mist, or shape into a swarm of small hopping drones to move about. When facing opponents, the nanoswarm could transform itself into a giant electroshock net across the ground, shape into a flotilla of seeker-armed flying drones, or link together as a set of massive whip-like tentacles to slice through their eshy foes. These nanoswarms are nearly impossible to destroy, as only a few nanobots need to survive in order to rebuild the swarm, and the new swarm will learn from the mistakes of the old.

Self-replicating nanoswarms follow the rules given for Nanoswarms and Microswarms, p. 328, with the following additions and exceptions: 

* They do not need to be sustained by a hive and do not deteriorate.  * They self-repair damage at the rate of 1d10 per half hour.  * They may nanofabricate new items, materials, or forms in half the standard timeframe (half an hour per Cost category).  * They may replicate any of the nanoswarm func- tions as noted on p. 328, as well as the functions of any other nanoswarm-using gear (smart dust, covert ops tool, repair spray, etc.).  * They may make SOM Tests.  * At the gamemaster’s discretion, they may adapt  new defenses against attacks used against them. New defenses take a minimum of 2 hours to devise and replicate throughout the swarm, after which such an attack will in ict minimal or no damage.  * Assume they have any skill they need at a minimum of 40. Such skills may rapidly improve as needed.

Wastewalker,Exsurgent,"Smooth white masks, floating out of shadows and flame, looking inexplicably hungry through doll’s eyes and expressionless dashes of mouths—the wastewalkers on the march were the last sight of many transhumans. These exsurgent cyborgs were employed by the TITANs as elite infantry during the Fall. Wastewalkers are intelligent and tactically minded, and they frequently commanded other exsurgents and TITAN puppets as shock troops, indirect  re spotters, and cannon fodder.

The masks themselves are the infection vector. Wastewalkers (or other TITAN minions) restrain captured biomorphs and force them to wear the mask until it melds to the face, beginning the transformation. Incorporation into the wastewalker social structure takes place within the hour, and the new exsurgent begins following orders from the tribe’s alpha. The victim grows tall and wiry over the course of days: the virus stretching and perverting the joints of the fingers, arms, and legs. Claws extrude from the nails and elbows, poking out of the featureless black polymer armor that slowly replaces the skin. Thin cylinders protrude from a hump on the back, each housing a hive of fabricator or disassembler nanoswarms. Excess body mass from the transformation moves to the hump and is used as feedstock. No one has ever successfully recovered an ego from a biomorph infected with the wastewalker strain.

Since the departure of the TITANs, feral wastewalkers look to their tribe’s alpha for orders. They communicate in bursts of encrypted digital static. Groups survive by hunting small animals, gathering vegetation, and assaulting any transhumans foolish enough to come close. In especially lean times, wastewalkers go dormant and allow their hives to feed on surrounding materials.",,,XR.148,"COG:15, COO:30, INT:15, REF:15, SAV:2, SOM:15, WIL:10, SPD:2, DUR:50",FALSE,"Freerunning 60, Infiltration 40, Kinetic Weapons 80, Profession: Small Unit Tactics 60, Throwing Weapons 70, Unarmed Combat 40, Perception 40 (Hearing/Vision), Fray 70",14/8,Walker,4/20/20,"Chameleon Skin, Claws, Efficient Digestion, Enhanced Hearing, Enhanced Respiration, Enhanced Vision, Medichines, Neurachem (Level 1), Skinlink, Specialized Hive: Disassembler, Specialized Hive: Fabricator, Temperature Tolerance, Toxin Filters",,,,Railgun SMG; Frag Grenade {Sticky}; Claws,1d10
