They sport near-monomolecular edges capable of piercing armor and spreading infection. Spurs are capable of limited movement but have no way of sensing their environment. Each nightmarish appendage has a mind of its own.

Creeper,Exsurgent,"Creepers are amorphous clouds of small, black bubbles that spread across and destroy nearly everything they touch, converting all matter into additional creeper mass. Even under enhanced vision and multiple wavelengths, creepers appear out-of-focus and ill-defined due a visual refraction effect. Firewall operates under the theory that creepers are autonomous femtobot swarms, designed by the TITANs as an area-denial weapon and programmed to disassemble everything at the atomic level. Like TITAN nanoswarms, creepers have the capability to manufacture materials and items, including weapons, gases, and mechanical traps, but because they work at an even smaller level they can temporarily create advanced materials with superconducting, supercomputing, superdense, or even invisible properties, among others. These materials are theorized to be constructed from degenerate matter or strange matter fluids, somehow kept stable at standard gravities. Creeper temperatures remain at about 45 C regardless of activity.

Though creeper clouds move slowly, crawling or floating, they sometimes construct mobility systems enabling faster movement. They can penetrate almost any material in a short amount of time, interface with electronics and implants, and convert a standard morph in a matter of minutes. They can transform into a strange matter mass that has a repulsive effect on normal matter, either as a swift attack or a sustained effect to keep hostile elements at bay. Creepers are known to act with intelligence and purpose, establishing traps and adapting to threats. It is suspected that the TITANs used them for facility manufacturing, infiltration, and command-and-control purposes.

Unlike other exsurgents, creepers are not created via infection, but by transmutation through contact with an existing creeper swarm. Can be invisible, like a nanoswarm, or materialize forms with refractive metamaterials, like an invisibility cloak.

Digital Exsurgent Virus,Exsurgent,"Digital strains of the Exsurgent Virus are purely information- or code- based versions of the virus. They resemble advanced computer viruses, worms, and trojans. They spread throughout the mesh, exploit holes, mimic protocols, and bypass security measures just like a skilled hacker. Digital versions of the exsurgent virus are treated as intelligent programs, using the same rules as infomorphs.

As a matter of course, this exsurgent virus will seek to access any new systems it comes into contact with, hacking in and copying a version of itself. The attack is handled as an Opposed Test, each rolling COG + INT. If the exsurgent virus wins, the target is infected and will be corrupted by the virus in 10 Action Turns, minus 1 turn per 10 full points of MoS. If the target succeeded but rolled lower than the virus, they are aware that they are slowly being taken over. This immediately causes them 1d10 points of mental stress. An infected program has only one option for defending itself before the virus takes over—shutdown and reboot. It takes the AI or infomorph 1 full Action Turn to shut down. Restarting takes 3 full Action Turns (possibly longer if the gamemaster so decides), upon which the AI or infomorph must make another Opposed COG + INT Test against the virus. If this test also fails, then the virus has already embedded itself in the AI or infomorph’s code and will continue its infection.

Wastewalker,Exsurgent,"Smooth white masks, floating out of shadows and flame, looking inexplicably hungry through doll’s eyes and expressionless dashes of mouths—the wastewalkers on the march were the last sight of many transhumans. These exsurgent cyborgs were employed by the TITANs as elite infantry during the Fall. Wastewalkers are intelligent and tactically minded, and they frequently commanded other exsurgents and TITAN puppets as shock troops, indirect  re spotters, and cannon fodder.

The masks themselves are the infection vector. Wastewalkers (or other TITAN minions) restrain captured biomorphs and force them to wear the mask until it melds to the face, beginning the transformation. Incorporation into the wastewalker social structure takes place within the hour, and the new exsurgent begins following orders from the tribe’s alpha. The victim grows tall and wiry over the course of days: the virus stretching and perverting the joints of the fingers, arms, and legs. Claws extrude from the nails and elbows, poking out of the featureless black polymer armor that slowly replaces the skin. Thin cylinders protrude from a hump on the back, each housing a hive of fabricator or disassembler nanoswarms. Excess body mass from the transformation moves to the hump and is used as feedstock. No one has ever successfully recovered an ego from a biomorph infected with the wastewalker strain.

Since the departure of the TITANs, feral wastewalkers look to their tribe’s alpha for orders. They communicate in bursts of encrypted digital static. Groups survive by hunting small animals, gathering vegetation, and assaulting any transhumans foolish enough to come close. In especially lean times, wastewalkers go dormant and allow their hives to feed on surrounding materials.",,,XR.148,"COG:15, COO:30, INT:15, REF:15, SAV:2, SOM:15, WIL:10, MOX:0, SPD:2, DUR:50",FALSE,"Freerunning 60, Infiltration 40, Kinetic Weapons 80, Profession: Small Unit Tactics 60, Throwing Weapons 70, Unarmed Combat 40, Perception 40 (Hearing/Vision), Fray 70",14/8,Walker,4/20/20,"Chameleon Skin, Claws, Efficient Digestion, Enhanced Hearing, Enhanced Respiration, Enhanced Vision, Medichines, Neurachem (Level 1), Skinlink, Specialized Hive: Disassembler, Specialized Hive: Fabricator, Temperature Tolerance, Toxin Filters",,,,Railgun SMG; Frag Grenade {Sticky}; Claws,1d10
Causapod,Neogenetic,"Causapods are an interesting example of successful genetic design gone awry. The original causapod was the winner of a Tharsis League contest to create a new neogenetic creature—a new life form created from scratch (or at least with a minimum threshold of original design; a certain degree of chimerical traits were allowed) and adapted for Mars. Best described as “land octopi,” causapods are multi-limbed, with 4 primary limbs and 6 smaller ones under their mantle. They can skitter along quickly and rapidly climb surfaces they can dig their spikes into. They feature strong jaws which they can use for scooping up lizards or digging up worms, both found in areas with abundant Martian fauna. Breathing vents enable them to survive in the Martian atmosphere, and adaptive coloration provides camouflage among the rocks and soil.

As the contest winner, the causapod’s neogenetic templates were open-sourced. Unexpectedly, the creature’s look became a major hit on the mesh, popularized with “mandibular crawdiddy” memes. This spurred intense interest from various biohacker circles, who quickly ran amok with the open-source designs. Hundreds of variants were genehacked together, many with absurd or dangerous traits: phosphorescent, chittering, slick, acid-spitting, armored/spiked, and even exploding. Anon-affiliated biohackers released some of these dangerous variants for real-life griefing purposes, including harassment of metacelebrities and interference with Consortium development plans. Numerous causapod species now live free in the Martian wilds, and some have been known to attack people.",,,XR.98,"COG:5, COO:20, INT:20, REF:20, SAV:1, SOM:10, WIL:5, MOX:0, SPD:1, DUR:25",FALSE,"Climbing 40, Freerunning 30, Scrounging 30, Unarmed Combat 40 (Bite), Fray 30, Perception 30 (Hearing/Smell)",4/2,Walker,6/30/30,"Chameleon Skin, Eelware, Enhanced, Hearing, Enhanced Smell, Enhanced Respiration, Poison Gland, Temperature Tolerance",,,,Causapod Bite,(1d10 / 2) + 2

Aquarium Pet,Smart Animal,"Not so much a pet as a prison, aquarium pets are transgenic aquarium animals such as koi, plecos, or axolotls that have been implanted with a ghostrider module. The ghostrider module has no control over the animal’s body but is fully wired into its sensorium as if it were living a real-time XP recording. An ego “sleeved” into an aquarium pet experiences being a  sh, from the sensation of swimming to autonomic drives such as hunger and urination. Many of these sensations, such as the pleco’s rasping at the soft aquarium wood to which it clings with its sucker-like mouth or the koi’s constant ri ing of  lthy bottom gravel with its mouth, are deeply revolting to most transhumans. In addition, the animals used often have good hearing, meaning the sleeved ego can make out conversations outside the tank.

Aquarium pets are physically helpless, as the ego cannot control the animal. The animal behaves instinctively, avoiding nets with a Fray skill of 40 in water, flopping around helplessly out of it. The ghostrider module imposes no modifiers to the ego’s mental stats and is usually connected to a cortical stack, but it has no access to control interfaces.

Egos unwillingly placed into an aquarium pet must make a WIL x 2 Test when rst “sleeved” and every week thereafter. The ego takes 1d10 SV on a failed test. If the aquarium pet dies with the ego in it, the ghostrider module ceases running and may only be re-instanced from the cortical stack (if any). Most aquarium pets have a DUR of 1 or 2. The ghostrider module and stack take up enough space in these creatures that an observer who makes an Academics (Biology) Test or a Perception Test at –20 realizes the animal contains implants, though they won’t know what kind of implants.

Fractals are deceptively potent adversaries, having the capability to dismantle almost anything at the molecular level, much like a disassembler nanoswarm (p. 329), and also to rebuild anything just like a nanofabricator (p. 327). Attacking them with projectiles is futile, as they absorb the ammunition, break it down into its constituent atoms or molecules, and then use those as components to build a weapon to use against you.

Fractals can be equipped with any type of gear the gamemaster desires—if they don’t have something, they can make it. Fractals are also able to nanofabricate items much more quickly than transhuman nanofabricators; reduce all times by half (half an hour per Cost category). Fractals are difficult to damage, as their “bodies” are actually airy assemblages of fractal branches. Any damaged branches that are broken off are caught and absorbed by others. Reduce damage from all standard non-area effect or spray attacks to the minimum possible damage. Area effect and spray weapons do half damage. Fractals are self-repairing, regenerating damage at the rate of 1d10 points per half hour and repairing wounds at the rate of 1 per hour after all damage is healed.

Self-Replicating Nanoswarm,TITAN,"The nanoswarms distributed by the TITANs are a step beyond the nanotechnology available to transhumanity. Unlike transhuman-created nanoswarms, the TITAN swarms are autonomous, sapient, and self-replicating. They are also highly adaptive, meaning they are not single function but can modify themselves to perform almost any nanoswarm task. They may also nano-fabricate new materials, much like fractals (p. 383). Combined, these capabilities make these nanoswarms incredibly potent. When they encounter a new oppo- nent, they can scan the opponent’s capabilities and then fabricate offensive systems to use against them. When an opponent deploys a weapon system on the swarm, it will learn and adapt countermeasures that will make such attacks ineffective against the swarm in the future. These nanoswarms may also function like so-called utility fog, linking together into a physical lattice in order to create large-scale physical forms.

The possibilities for TITAN nanoswarms are almost limitless. For example, they may lie in wait as an invisible nanoscopic swarm, oat as barely visible mist, or shape into a swarm of small hopping drones to move about. When facing opponents, the nanoswarm could transform itself into a giant electroshock net across the ground, shape into a flotilla of seeker-armed flying drones, or link together as a set of massive whip-like tentacles to slice through their eshy foes. These nanoswarms are nearly impossible to destroy, as only a few nanobots need to survive in order to rebuild the swarm, and the new swarm will learn from the mistakes of the old.

Self-replicating nanoswarms follow the rules given for Nanoswarms and Microswarms, p. 328, with the following additions and exceptions: 

* They do not need to be sustained by a hive and do not deteriorate.  * They self-repair damage at the rate of 1d10 per half hour.  * They may nanofabricate new items, materials, or forms in half the standard timeframe (half an hour per Cost category).  * They may replicate any of the nanoswarm func- tions as noted on p. 328, as well as the functions of any other nanoswarm-using gear (smart dust, covert ops tool, repair spray, etc.).  * They may make SOM Tests.  * At the gamemaster’s discretion, they may adapt  new defenses against attacks used against them. New defenses take a minimum of 2 hours to devise and replicate throughout the swarm, after which such an attack will in ict minimal or no damage.  * Assume they have any skill they need at a minimum of 40. Such skills may rapidly improve as needed.

Blister Beast,Xenofauna,"A neo-chimp-sized arboreal predator species from the exoplanet Echo IV, blister beasts typically work in small groups. They lurk in the local tree analogs, moving about with impressive leaps and climbing ability. When attacking, they will drop on their prey and inflict a venomous sting or bat them out of the trees with vicious tail paddle strikes. Blister beasts are highly territorial and known to aggressively assault intruders.

Blister beasts evolved the namesake defensive mechanism as a protection from other predators. Their skin is mottled with dozens of pressurized pustules that explosively burst open when they are physically attacked, releasing a spray of noxious neurotoxin goop and a lingering caustic cloud.

Blister beasts can horizontally jump 6 meters (running)/2 meters (standing) and vertically jump 2 meters; +1/0.25/0.25 meters (respectively) per 10 MoS on as Freerunning Test. Any time the blister beast is struck, there is a (40 + DV in icted)% chance that one or more blisters burst and release a neurotoxin cloud (see below).",,,XR.97,"COG:5, COO:15, INT:15, REF:20, SAV:1, SOM:15, WIL:10, MOX:0, SPD:1, DUR:30",FALSE,"Climbing 60, Freerunning 50, Infiltration 60, Intimidation 30, Scrounging 60, Unarmed Combat 50 (Blister Beast Tail Strike), Perception 40 (Hearing/Smell), Fray 55",3/5,Walker,5/24/24,"Enhanced Hearing, Enhanced Smell",,,,Blister Beast Tail; Blister Beast Sting + Blister Beast Toxin; Blister Neurotoxin,
