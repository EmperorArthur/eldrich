Aquarium Pet,Smart Animals,"Not so much a pet as a prison, aquarium pets are transgenic aquarium animals such as koi, plecos, or axolotls that have been implanted with a ghostrider module. The ghostrider module has no control over the animal’s body but is fully wired into its sensorium as if it were living a real-time XP recording. An ego “sleeved” into an aquarium pet experiences being a  sh, from the sensation of swimming to autonomic drives such as hunger and urination. Many of these sensations, such as the pleco’s rasping at the soft aquarium wood to which it clings with its sucker-like mouth or the koi’s constant ri ing of  lthy bottom gravel with its mouth, are deeply revolting to most transhumans. In addition, the animals used often have good hearing, meaning the sleeved ego can make out conversations outside the tank.

Aquarium pets are physically helpless, as the ego cannot control the animal. The animal behaves instinctively, avoiding nets with a Fray skill of 40 in water, flopping around helplessly out of it. The ghostrider module imposes no modifiers to the ego’s mental stats and is usually connected to a cortical stack, but it has no access to control interfaces.

Egos unwillingly placed into an aquarium pet must make a WIL x 2 Test when rst “sleeved” and every week thereafter. The ego takes 1d10 SV on a failed test. If the aquarium pet dies with the ego in it, the ghostrider module ceases running and may only be re-instanced from the cortical stack (if any). Most aquarium pets have a DUR of 1 or 2. The ghostrider module and stack take up enough space in these creatures that an observer who makes an Academics (Biology) Test or a Perception Test at –20 realizes the animal contains implants, though they won’t know what kind of implants.

Fractal,TITANs,"Fractals are advanced bush robots. In their standard form, fractals resemble a strange sort of metallic bush surrounded with an eerie glittering haze. In their center are a number of metallic branches, linked together with a exible joint. Each of these branches splits into two or more smaller branches, also with exible joints. These branches also split, and then split again, and so on down to the molecular scale. The tip of each fractal branch ends in a nanoscale manipulator. Fractals are deceptively potent adversaries, having the capability to dismantle almost anything at the molecular level, much like a disassembler nanoswarm (p. 329), and also to rebuild anything just like a nanofabricator (p. 327). Attacking them with projectiles is futile, as they absorb the ammunition, break it down into its constituent atoms or molecules, and then use those as components to build a weapon to use against you.

Fractals can be equipped with any type of gear the gamemaster desires—if they don’t have something, they can make it. Fractals are also able to nanofabricate items much more quickly than transhuman nanofabricators; reduce all times by half (half an hour per Cost category). Fractals are difficult to damage, as their “bodies” are actually airy assemblages of fractal branches. Any damaged branches that are broken off are caught and absorbed by others. Reduce damage from all standard non-area effect or spray attacks to the minimum possible damage. Area effect and spray weapons do half damage. Fractals are self-repairing, regenerating damage at the rate of 1d10 points per half hour and repairing wounds at the rate of 1 per hour after all damage is healed.

Self-Replicating Nanoswarm,TITANs,"The nanoswarms distributed by the TITANs are a step beyond the nanotechnology available to transhumanity. Unlike transhuman-created nanoswarms, the TITAN swarms are autonomous, sapient, and self-replicating. They are also highly adaptive, meaning they are not single function but can modify themselves to perform almost any nanoswarm task. They may also nano-fabricate new materials, much like fractals (p. 383). Combined, these capabilities make these nanoswarms incredibly potent. When they encounter a new oppo- nent, they can scan the opponent’s capabilities and then fabricate offensive systems to use against them. When an opponent deploys a weapon system on the swarm, it will learn and adapt countermeasures that will make such attacks ineffective against the swarm in the future. These nanoswarms may also function like so-called utility fog, linking together into a physical lattice in order to create large-scale physical forms.

The possibilities for TITAN nanoswarms are almost limitless. For example, they may lie in wait as an invisible nanoscopic swarm, oat as barely visible mist, or shape into a swarm of small hopping drones to move about. When facing opponents, the nanoswarm could transform itself into a giant electroshock net across the ground, shape into a flotilla of seeker-armed flying drones, or link together as a set of massive whip-like tentacles to slice through their eshy foes. These nanoswarms are nearly impossible to destroy, as only a few nanobots need to survive in order to rebuild the swarm, and the new swarm will learn from the mistakes of the old.

Self-replicating nanoswarms follow the rules given for Nanoswarms and Microswarms, p. 328, with the following additions and exceptions: 

* They do not need to be sustained by a hive and do not deteriorate.  * They self-repair damage at the rate of 1d10 per half hour.  * They may nanofabricate new items, materials, or forms in half the standard timeframe (half an hour per Cost category).  * They may replicate any of the nanoswarm func- tions as noted on p. 328, as well as the functions of any other nanoswarm-using gear (smart dust, covert ops tool, repair spray, etc.).  * They may make SOM Tests.  * At the gamemaster’s discretion, they may adapt  new defenses against attacks used against them. New defenses take a minimum of 2 hours to devise and replicate throughout the swarm, after which such an attack will in ict minimal or no damage.  * Assume they have any skill they need at a minimum of 40. Such skills may rapidly improve as needed.
