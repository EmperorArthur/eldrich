Spambot Minion,Jamming,"Minions will attempt to jam TITAN communications and radar using universal jamming (p. 262, EP).",
Spambot Minion,Spam Mist,"Everyone within mesh range of the spambot suffers a −30 Perception Test modifier due to AR spam overload. This may be cleared with an Interfacing Test at −30, but will return after 10 minutes as the spam compensates for the filtering; see Traffic Filters and Mist, p. 248, EP. Alternatively, AR may be turned off, but this will disable tacnets and hinder other gear.",

Vydra,Frenzy,"If a vydra smells or tastes blood, it will enter into a murderous frenzy. Increase REF and Fray by +10, and the vydra can ignore the effects of 2 wounds. This effect lasts until the vydra has no more prey to kill in the immediate vicinity and it has gorged on its victim(s).",
Void Crawler,Gravity Sensitivity,"In gravity higher than 0.1 g, treat void crawlers as suffering from the effects of 1 wound. In gravity higher than 0.3 g, treat this as 2 wounds and reduce their Movement Rate by half. At 0.5 g and higher, they suffer DV 2 per minute and are effectively incapacitated.",
Void Crawler,Light Sensitivity,"Void crawlers are adapted to dim light. Extremely bright lights blind them, inflicting a −10 modifier or more.",
Void Crawler,Mindlink,Void crawlers remain mindlinked when within 15 meters of one other (and to others through each other).,
Veiled Leech,Pounce,"Veiled leeches often attack with surprise (no defense).

Think Tank,Deflectors,"Think tanks are equipped with supercapacitors embedded within their armor that release a massive charge at the area pinpointed by an attack, creating a temporary, huge, electromagnetic force field that repels or destroys incoming projectiles. This provides a −30 modifier to hit the tank, but only against kinetic weapon and seeker attacks that the think tank has detected. These deflectors have 20 uses before they must be recharged, which takes 2 hours.",
Stinger Hound,Camouflage,Stinger hounds that remain still and crouched under their shell receive a +30 to Infiltration Tests to hide.,
Stalker,Infrasonic Emitter,"All biomorphs within 30 meters must make a SOM Test or be nauseated and disoriented, suffering −30 to all actions for 1 minute.

This effect works through walls, ground, and water, but not vacuum.",
Snapper,Armored Variant,"Heavy Armor (+16/+16), Offensive Armor Mod (shock effect; p. 204, EP), Self-Healing Armor Mod, 2 Weapon Mounts (External, Articulated) with twin Railgun Machine Guns (DV 2d10 + 8, AP −9, BF/FA, Ammo 500)",
Slouch,Self-Destruct,"Slouches carry a small plasma magnetic bottle that will detonate when they take more than 75 points of damage or if anyone attempts to open up or otherwise tamper with a disabled slouch. This explosion inflicts DV 5d10 + 16, AP −6, blast area effect, and will completely destroy the slouch.",
Slouch,Bessel Beam Turret,"This device functions like a tractor/repulsor beam. Struck targets are pushed either directly towards or away from the slouch. The distance moved depends on the target’s size: very small, 20 meters; small: 10 meters; medium: 5 meters; large: 1 meter, very large: unaffected. Struck targets are trapped by the beam and must make a SOM Test to escape its grasp or they will continue to be attracted/repelled each Action Turn. Max Range 500. These turrets have 20 turns of use and take 4 hours to recharge.",
Skrik,Bioware,"Skriks will have the same bioware as their exsurgent parent, but not cyberware or nanoware. Some skriks will have mutations such as Claws, Extra Limbs, Poison Gland, etc.",

Skitter,Microswarm,"Skitters follow the rules for (Swarms, p. 168). Stats given are for a standard swarm unit, not individual microbots.",
Skitter,Jam Radio,"Radios and radar suffers interference, imposing a –30 modifier on all sensor-related tests. Targets may attempt to overcome this interference by beating the skitter in an Opposed Interface Test.",
Skitter,Blinding Lasers,"Skitter swarms may deploy lasers to blind cameras much like a dazzler (p. 316, EP). 
These lasers will blind characters as well for 1 minute unless they make a REF x 3 Test. Anti-glare cyberware protects against blinding.",
Skitter,Sabotage,"DV 1d10 each Action Turn (no defense, armor applies but is reduced) to all synthmorphs and non-biological devices touched by and targeted by the swarm.",
Shifter,Mimicry,"Succeeds with an Opposed Impersonation vs. Kinesics Test. The synthetic nature of mimicked biomorphs is obvious with t-rays or physical contact, or an enhanced vision/radar Perception Test at −30.",
Shifter,Shape Adjusting,"Shifters change form in half the timeframe of transhuman tech and can create complex, mechanical forms such as firearms or implants.",
Puppet Elite Agent,Basilisk Hack,"Deployed via augmented reality. See Basilisk Hacks, p. 365, EP.",
Ny’knikiin,Ny’knikiin software,"Ny’knikiin software is radically different from transhuman designs. Attempts to use or subvert ny’knikiin gear require extensive study (timeframe: 1 week)and suffer a −30 modifier. Ny’knikiin hackers are common and have software comparable to transhuman equivalents, but are at a similar disadvantage working with transhuman systems.",
Mantis Worm,Acid Plume,"Threatened swarms release a plume of acid in the water, extending 5 meters around the swarm. Anyone caught in this plume suffers DV 1d10 ÷ 2 each turn and must make a SOM x 2 Test or flee (negated by Pain Tolerance).",
Guardian Brute,Intimidating,Brutes receive a +20 modifier on Intimidation Tests.,
Guardian Brute,Decoy Weapons,"Brutes are sometimes equipped or implanted with obvious but fake heavy weapons systems, such as seekers or plasma rifles. These may be spotted as fake with a Perception Test at −30.",
Guardian Brute,Bullet Magnet,Brutes are modified to soak as much damage as possible. They may ignore the effects of 2 wounds.,
Guardian Spider Head,Volatile,Any damaging hit on a spider bot has a (20 + DV inflicted)% chance of setting off the explosives it carries.,
Leftover Special Snack Bar,Flesh Regeneration,Snack bars regenerate 1d10 damage or 1 wound per hour; all damage must be healed before wounds.,
Sapient Defiler,Fear Pheremones,"Defilers emit pheromones tailored to trigger fear and flight responses in human biomorphs. Apply a +10 to Intimidation Tests when applicable. At the gamemaster’s discretion, close proximity to a defiler may provoke a WIL x 3 Test; if the human fails, they must flee for at least 2 Action Turns.",
Feral Defiler,Fear Pheremones,"Defilers emit pheromones tailored to trigger fear and flight responses in human biomorphs. Apply a +10 to Intimidation Tests when applicable. At the gamemaster’s discretion, close proximity to a defiler may provoke a WIL x 3 Test; if the human fails, they must flee for at least 2 Action Turns.",
Sapient Defiler,Defiler Egg,"Victims stung by defilers are unaware they have been injected with eggs. For the first 2 days, they show no symptoms, and Medicine Tests suffer a −30 modifier to detect the parasitoids. On the third day, they suffer intense cramping and pain, taking DV 2d10 every hour as the larvae feed on their organs. This damage cannot be healed until the parasitoids are removed. Removing them is a Medicine Task Action (1 hour). There is a 30% chance that attempting to eradicate the larvae will force them to rapidly chew out and evacuate the body (inflicting DV 2d10). Otherwise the larvae eat their way out once the victim has died, consuming the corpse before scurrying off.",

Larval Defiler,Defiler Cocoon,"Larval defilers ensconce themselves in a cocoon, taking 1 week to transform into an adult. The cocoon itself offers 15/10 Armor, but the defilers inside are helpless and vulnerable during the metamorphosis (Durability 5).",
Land Anemone,Tentacle Toxin,"Dermal, Onset: 1 Action Turn, Duration: 3 Action Turns/1 hour. Inflicts DV 2d10 + 10 per turn for 3 Action Turns and paralyzes for 1 hour. A SOM x 2 Test negates the paralyzation. Medichines reduce damage by half and apply +30 modifier to test.",
Killer Spambot,DoS Attack,"Target must be traced first (p. 258, EP). Opposed Infosec Test; if successful, target is −1 Speed and has a 10% chance of suffering a glitch (p. 144, Transhuman). See DoS Attacks, p. 147 and 149, Transhuman.",
Killer Spambot,Lockout,"Target must be zeroed in and locked first (p. 257, EP). Opposed Infosec Test with intruder at −20; if successful, target intruder is locked out of system (p. 258, EP)",

Killer Spambot,Spam Mist,"Everyone within mesh range suffers a −30 Perception modifier due to AR spam overload. This may be cleared with an Interfacing Test at −30, but will return after 10 minutes as the spam compensates for the filtering; see Traffic Filters and Mist, p. 248, EP. Alternatively, AR may be turned off, but this will disable tacnets and hinder other gear.",
Jelly,Corrosive Coating/Spit,"Application: D, O; Onset Time: 1 Action Turn; Duration: 5 Action Turns; Effect: DV 1d10 ÷ 2 (round up) per Action Turn, armor protects but is reduced by the DV. Subdued victims suffer DV 1d10. This coating also provides immunity to nanoswarms, corrosives, and dermal-vector drugs and chemicals. Liquid-based attacks against the jelly suffer a −30 modifier. ",
Jelly,Exsurgent Infection,Jellies can infect other biomorphs with the jelly xenomorph strain by exchanging bodily fluids.,
Jelly,Invulnerability,Jellies take minimum DV from kinetic weapons and blades.,
Jelly,Lubrication,Jellies are immune to subdual attempts.,
Jelly,Vacuum Expansion,Jellies gain the Large Size trait in vacuum (+10 to hit).,
Mimc Jelly,Corrosive Coating/Spit,"Application: D, O; Onset Time: 1 Action Turn; Duration: 5 Action Turns; Effect: DV 1d10 ÷ 2 (round up) per Action Turn, armor protects but is reduced by the DV. Subdued victims suffer DV 1d10. This coating also provides immunity to nanoswarms, corrosives, and dermal-vector drugs and chemicals. Liquid-based attacks against the jelly suffer a −30 modifier. ",
Mimc Jelly,Exsurgent Infection,Jellies can infect other biomorphs with the jelly xenomorph strain by exchanging bodily fluids.,
Mimc Jelly,Invulnerability,Jellies take minimum DV from kinetic weapons and blades.,
Mimc Jelly,Lubrication,Jellies are immune to subdual attempts.,
Mimc Jelly,Vacuum Expansion,Jellies gain the Large Size trait in vacuum (+10 to hit).,
Mimc Jelly,Mimicry,"Mimic jellies take the form of their pre-exsurgent self or victims they engulf (+30 to Disguise Tests). Absorbing and copying a victim takes half an hour. The jelly takes on the victim’s memories, skills, and ego traits. Their gelatinous nature is immediately noticeable with t-rays or physical contact, or with an enhanced vision/radar Perception Test at −30. Characters familiar with the victim may notice oddities with an Opposed Impersonation vs. Kinesics Test. Mimic jellies may only imitate one biomorph at a time. To reset, another transhuman must be consumed",
Immolator Mother,Exsurgent Infection,Mothers infect biomorphs with the glory exsurgent virus (p. 175) by exchanging bodily fluids.,
Immolator Breeder,Exsurgent Infection,Breeders infect biomorphs with the glory exsurgent virus (p. 175) by exchanging bodily fluids.,
Hunter-Killer,Deflectors,"Some advanced hunter-killer models are equipped with supercapacitors embedded within their armor that release a massive charge at the area pinpointed by an attack, creating a temporary, huge, electromagnetic force field that repels or destroys incoming projectiles. This provides a −30 modifier to hit the hunter-killer, but only against kinetic weapon and seeker attacks that the hunter- killer has detected. These deflectors have 20 uses before they must be recharged, which takes 2 hours.",
Hookbladder,Pain Tolerance,"In their breeding cycle, hookbladders develop a resistance to pain. They ignore the effects of 2 wounds and will not react to fire, acid, or agonizers.",
Hookbladder,Parasitic Control,"Once a hookbladder envelopes a biomorph victim’s head, it extends shoots into the victim’s orifices and through the area pierced by its hook. These tie the victim to the hookbladder’s metabolism and, in the case of transhumans, allow them to function without breathers in Teragula’s normally asphyxiating atmosphere. This will inflict DV 1d10 ÷ 2, no defense, for 3 Action Turns. If the hookbladder is not removed in 2 Action Turns, it will dominate the target’s mind. The only way to remove the hookbladder is to kill it or forcibly pull it off with an Opposed SOM x 3 Test; subdued victims suffer −30 on this test. Forced removal inflicts DV 1d10, no defense, as the hook rips free. Biomorphs saved from hookbladder infestation quickly (in less than 10 minutes) recover rapidly, but those infested longer require time in a healing vat to repair damage to their nervous system (−10 to all actions until they do).",
Hookbladder,Shock Resistance,The primitive neural systems of hookbladders are immune to shock effects.,
Hookbladder,Biomorph Preference,"Hookbladders breathe through their skin membranes. They will ignore synthmorphs and robots unless attacked. Their hook attack can still damage synthetic shells, but the parasitization only affects biomorphs.",
Hollow,Caustic Gas,"Hollows deploy caustic smoke for defense: Dermal, Onset Time: 1 Action Turn, Duration: 3 Action Turns/1 minute. This gas blocks vision and thermal within a 10-meter radius, reduces the range of laser pulsers by half, and inflicts DV 1d10 to biomorphs (no defense) per turn for 3 Action Turns. Damaged victims must make a SOM x 2 Test or be blinded for 1 minute.",
Hollow,Mimicry,"The nanoplasma may invade any creature it touches. It is slow-moving and easy to avoid (Fray Test at +20), preferring incapacitated or surprised victims. “Mapping” inflicts 1d10 DV per Action Turn (accumulated damage inflicts wounds) and is exceptionally painful; victims without Pain Tolerance are incapacitated, those without Pain Tolerance (Level Two) suffer −20 to all actions. Nanophages double the time and halve the damage. After 10 minutes, the host is disassembled and a skin suit is formed. The hollow absorbs the victim’s memories, skills, and ego traits (Kinesics Test at −30 to notice a difference). Hollows can mimic previous victims.",
Hollow,Nanoplasma Invulnerability,"Most attacks simply inflict DV 1. Area-effect, plasma, and fire attacks inflict half damage. Nanoplasma is immune to wounds. EMP has no effect.",
Hollow,Node Nucleus,"Nodes are difficult to find (Perception Test at −30). If destroyed, the hollow is irrevocably killed. Nodes have Armor 30/30 and Durability 50.",
Hollow,Regeneration,Hollow nanoplasma repairs 1d10 damage per hour.,
Headhunter Mk II,Onboard Fabber,Can fabricate a new seeker missile in 30 minutes.,
Gut Eeater,Possession,"Forcing its way down a throat is an Opposed Test between the gut eater’s REF x 3 (60) and the victim’s SOM x 2 and inflicts DV 1d10 (armor does not apply). If successful, the gut eater burrows into the victim’s abdomen, inflicting 10 DV (no defense). Within 10 Action Turns, it extends neural filaments, linking to the host’s brain and nervous system. Once the parasite wins an Opposed WIL x 3 Test, it subverts the host’s biological mind (if it fails, it will attempt every 10 minutes with a cumulative +10 modifier as it exerts more connections and control over the host). Dominated transhumans suffer SV 2d10. Gut eaters perceive through their hosts’ senses, though they suffer −30 modifiers on the first day. Gut eaters cannot control biomorphs with cyberbrains. Over the next week, the gut eater will slowly extrude its mouth and tentacle arms through the victim’s abdomen.",
