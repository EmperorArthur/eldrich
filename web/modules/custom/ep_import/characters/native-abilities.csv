Feral Defiler,Fear Pheremones,"Defilers emit pheromones tailored to trigger fear and flight responses in human biomorphs. Apply a +10 to Intimidation Tests when applicable. At the gamemaster’s discretion, close proximity to a defiler may provoke a WIL x 3 Test; if the human fails, they must flee for at least 2 Action Turns.",
Feral Defiler,Defiler Egg,"Victims stung by defilers are unaware they have been injected with eggs. For the first 2 days, they show no symptoms, and Medicine Tests suffer a −30 modifier to detect the parasitoids. On the third day, they suffer intense cramping and pain, taking DV 2d10 every hour as the larvae feed on their organs. This damage cannot be healed until the parasitoids are removed. Removing them is a Medicine Task Action (1 hour). There is a 30% chance that attempting to eradicate the larvae will force them to rapidly chew out and evacuate the body (inflicting DV 2d10). Otherwise the larvae eat their way out once the victim has died, consuming the corpse before scurrying off.",

Gut Eeater,Possession,"Forcing its way down a throat is an Opposed Test between the gut eater’s REF x 3 (60) and the victim’s SOM x 2 and inflicts DV 1d10 (armor does not apply). If successful, the gut eater burrows into the victim’s abdomen, inflicting 10 DV (no defense). Within 10 Action Turns, it extends neural filaments, linking to the host’s brain and nervous system. Once the parasite wins an Opposed WIL x 3 Test, it subverts the host’s biological mind (if it fails, it will attempt every 10 minutes with a cumulative +10 modifier as it exerts more connections and control over the host). Dominated transhumans suffer SV 2d10. Gut eaters perceive through their hosts’ senses, though they suffer −30 modifiers on the first day. Gut eaters cannot control biomorphs with cyberbrains. Over the next week, the gut eater will slowly extrude its mouth and tentacle arms through the victim’s abdomen.",
Headhunter Mk II,Onboard Fabber,Can fabricate a new seeker missile in 30 minutes.,
Hollow,Caustic Gas,"Hollows deploy caustic smoke for defense: Dermal, Onset Time: 1 Action Turn, Duration: 3 Action Turns/1 minute. This gas blocks vision and thermal within a 10-meter radius, reduces the range of laser pulsers by half, and inflicts DV 1d10 to biomorphs (no defense) per turn for 3 Action Turns. Damaged victims must make a SOM x 2 Test or be blinded for 1 minute.",
Hollow,Mimicry,"The nanoplasma may invade any creature it touches. It is slow-moving and easy to avoid (Fray Test at +20), preferring incapacitated or surprised victims. “Mapping” inflicts 1d10 DV per Action Turn (accumulated damage inflicts wounds) and is exceptionally painful; victims without Pain Tolerance are incapacitated, those without Pain Tolerance (Level Two) suffer −20 to all actions. Nanophages double the time and halve the damage. After 10 minutes, the host is disassembled and a skin suit is formed. The hollow absorbs the victim’s memories, skills, and ego traits (Kinesics Test at −30 to notice a difference). Hollows can mimic previous victims.",
Hollow,Nanoplasma Invulnerability,"Most attacks simply inflict DV 1. Area-effect, plasma, and fire attacks inflict half damage. Nanoplasma is immune to wounds. EMP has no effect.",

Hollow,Regeneration,Hollow nanoplasma repairs 1d10 damage per hour.,
Hookbladder,Pain Tolerance,"In their breeding cycle, hookbladders develop a resistance to pain. They ignore the effects of 2 wounds and will not react to fire, acid, or agonizers.",
Hookbladder,Parasitic Control,"Once a hookbladder envelopes a biomorph victim’s head, it extends shoots into the victim’s orifices and through the area pierced by its hook. These tie the victim to the hookbladder’s metabolism and, in the case of transhumans, allow them to function without breathers in Teragula’s normally asphyxiating atmosphere. This will inflict DV 1d10 ÷ 2, no defense, for 3 Action Turns. If the hookbladder is not removed in 2 Action Turns, it will dominate the target’s mind. The only way to remove the hookbladder is to kill it or forcibly pull it off with an Opposed SOM x 3 Test; subdued victims suffer −30 on this test. Forced removal inflicts DV 1d10, no defense, as the hook rips free. Biomorphs saved from hookbladder infestation quickly (in less than 10 minutes) recover rapidly, but those infested longer require time in a healing vat to repair damage to their nervous system (−10 to all actions until they do).",
Hookbladder,Shock Resistance,The primitive neural systems of hookbladders are immune to shock effects.,
Hookbladder,Biomorph Preference,"Hookbladders breathe through their skin membranes. They will ignore synthmorphs and robots unless attacked. Their hook attack can still damage synthetic shells, but the parasitization only affects biomorphs.",
Hookbladder Zombie,Hookbladder Mask,"Because the parasite remains attached to the victim’s head, attempts to target it are likely to hurt the victim as well. Treat such attacks as called shots (−10 to hit); if the attacker does not succeed with an MoS of 30+, split the damage evenly between the hookbladder and zombie. ",
Hookbladder Zombie,Killing Machine,"Hookbladder zombies are pre-occupied with murder, with little regard for their own protection. They receive a +10 modifier to attack; attacks against them also receive a +10 to hit. Zombies are sometimes clever enough to use melee weapons, but are unlikely to use ranged weapons; most simply attack unarmed.",
Hookbladder Zombie,Linked Metabolism,Zombies can “breathe” underwater or in Teragula’s atmosphere.,
Hookbladder Zombie,Muses,"The hookbladder’s minuscule intelligence makes mesh inserts useless, but muses belonging to the victim are unaffected and may contact others via the mesh in search of help. Cutting down a zombie while their muse pleads for mercy inflicts SV 1d10.",
Hunter-Killer,Deflectors,"Some advanced hunter-killer models are equipped with supercapacitors embedded within their armor that release a massive charge at the area pinpointed by an attack, creating a temporary, huge, electromagnetic force field that repels or destroys incoming projectiles. This provides a −30 modifier to hit the hunter-killer, but only against kinetic weapon and seeker attacks that the hunter- killer has detected. These deflectors have 20 uses before they must be recharged, which takes 2 hours.",
Immolator Breeder,Exsurgent Infection,Breeders infect biomorphs with the glory exsurgent virus (p. 175) by exchanging bodily fluids.,

This may be cleared with an Interfacing Test at −30, but will return after 10 minutes as the spam compensates for the filtering; see Traffic Filters and Mist, p. 248, EP. Alternatively, AR may be turned off, but this will disable tacnets and hinder other gear.",
Land Anemone,Tentacle Toxin,"Dermal, Onset: 1 Action Turn, Duration: 3 Action Turns/1 hour. Inflicts DV 2d10 + 10 per turn for 3 Action Turns and paralyzes for 1 hour. A SOM x 2 Test negates the paralyzation. Medichines reduce damage by half and apply +30 modifier to test.",
Larval Defiler,Defiler Cocoon,"Larval defilers ensconce themselves in a cocoon, taking 1 week to transform into an adult. The cocoon itself offers 15/10 Armor, but the defilers inside are helpless and vulnerable during the metamorphosis (Durability 5).",
Leftover Special Snack Bar,Flesh Regeneration,Snack bars regenerate 1d10 damage or 1 wound per hour; all damage must be healed before wounds.,

The jelly takes on the victim’s memories, skills, and ego traits. Their gelatinous nature is immediately noticeable with t-rays or physical contact, or with an enhanced vision/radar Perception Test at −30. Characters familiar with the victim may notice oddities with an Opposed Impersonation vs. Kinesics Test. Mimic jellies may only imitate one biomorph at a time. To reset, another transhuman must be consumed",
Ny’knikiin,Ny’knikiin software,"Ny’knikiin software is radically different from transhuman designs.
