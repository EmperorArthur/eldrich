Before the Fall, Alice was part of one of the most wanted anarchist cells in China. She spent several years in prison under horrific conditions before being liberated during the conflicts that preceded the Fall. While many of the other old collective members have moved on to pursue other interests, Alice has remained with EDF and the swarm. Along with Singh and Andropov, she has become a respected voice of wisdom in the fleet. She is often delegated the responsibility of dealing with outside authorities on behalf of the fleet—primarily because she is one of the few EDF members who can talk to hypercorp and socialite elites at length without totally losing her shit.","Despite often being placed in a spokes-person/delegate role, Alice is very concerned about being perceived as a leader. She takes care not to act in any way that hasn’t been authorized by a collective or swarm decision. Given her prominent stature, she tends to excuse herself from much of the EDF’s anti-Consortium subversive activities for better deniability. Her primary concern is the health and safety of the fleet—she is acutely aware of the various threats to the swarm, both internal and external. Alice still occasionally suffers PTSD from her time in prison, though she is quite adept at hiding this from prying eyes.

A rebellious kid with a knack for computers, she has grown to become a skilled infosec specialist and programmer. Along with a few other hackers in the swarm, she has been involved in various Decepticon (p. 46, Panopticon) projects that aim to seed mesh networks around the inner system with false data.

Through the Decepticon network, Amrita was recruited into Firewall two years ago. Her skills were needed to help cover the tracks of a sentinel team active on Venus. During this time she learned about a potential TITAN threat that lingered in the Venusian cloud layer and has over time been brought up to speed on other affairs, like the exsurgent virus and the existence of asyncs. She combines her extracurricular activities, seeding data via the Decepticons in a way that helps to conceal the existence of things that Firewall would prefer to remain unknown to the public.

Hacking is not Amrita’s only specialty: she also sidelines as a porn XP star and producer. Her attractive four-armed bouncer morph is a common sight in the many porn sims and playback recordings the swarm produces. She peddles the XP she produces around the inner system, using it as currency and bribes to support her hacktivism endeavors.","Amrita is young and excitable. She is really engaged in her work with the Decepticons, making it a point to spread disinformation at every habitat the swarm visits. The porn biz is more her recreational activity than a side gig—something she enjoys doing and which just happens to support her other projects. She is unsure what to make of Firewall.

She joined only three years ago and her ego is only seventeen years old. She was seven when the Fall happened and barely remembers it, some- times getting annoyed at the others around her who dwell on the event and refuse to move on. While she didn’t grow up in the Stars swarm, she was raised on another scum  eet in the Jupiter system and finds the Stars scum to be a bit more buttoned down and staid than her home flotilla.

Barking Dog has made quite a reputation for herself with the Dogonauts by using her contacts to score the newest and hottest mind-altering substances from her outer system scum contacts. She often seeks out new faces on the swarm—travelers and tourists— in the hopes of getting them high and hearing their stories. On a couple of occasions, Singh has convinced her to cozy up to outsiders and squeeze information out of them.","Barking Dog seems to have two personality modes. When she’s getting to know someone or trying to get a favor, she is attentive, flirtatious, and sensual. The rest of the time she comes off as a cocky kid who shows little respect to anyone and often seems only to be half paying attention to anyone speaking to her, likely because she is high. While she’ll readily promise to get any substance for anybody, she often forgets and has started to develop a reputation for being flaky.

Dog is sleeved in a sylph morph she managed to score from someone passing through the swarm.

Doctor Mindfuck,,SOD.11,Neurodivergent Psychosurgeon,Scum,"+Recreational Psychosurgery, +Drug Use, –Informal Hierarchies",,"Dr. Boris Simic was a well-off psychosurgeon working for the Serbian government. Specifically employed as a loyalty tester, he gained an incredible amount of insight into the inner thoughts of bureaucrats and career politicos. When TITAN nanoviruses hit Eastern Europe, he was reassigned to help government of cials who had contracted mind-altering infections. In the course of his work, Simic fell victim to one of these plagues, suffering from severe mood swings. Considered a liability, he was ineligible for evacuation. Betrayed by his own government, Simic managed to bribe his way on board a refugee shuttle that barely made it into orbit. Rescued by HAL strikers, Simic stayed with the refugees when the swarm departed Earth.

Simic adopted well to the scum lifestyle, engaging in heavy petal use as a way of coping with his traumatic experiences and letting go of many of his former inhibitions. He quickly turned his talents towards experimental procedures and offered his services to anyone desiring a recreational mental alteration. Though his attempts to counter his own neurological damage have failed—and may even have exacerbated his condition—there is no question that he is skilled at shaping minds. Many scum make regular trips to his offices, seeking new mind-sets, new outlooks on life, or just a new type of trip. Over the years, Simic adopted the nickname many of the scum were using for him, and now introduces himself as Dr. Mindfuck to everyone he meets.

In recent years, Dr. Mindfuck has become an outspoken critic of the EDF and Alice Chu. He consistently calls them out as the “hidden leadership” and “secret elites” of the fleet, noting the similarities to the mindsets of the many bureaucrats and politicos he dealt with in the past. Though he has few close friends and is not part of a collective, Dr. Mindfuck has earned some respect and allies for his outspoken-ness. Some of these supporters see actual wisdom in his critiques, while others just see him as a useful tool in the political dynamics of the fleet.","Dr. Mindfuck’s susceptibility to mood swings makes him an interesting person to be around—he quite suddenly can go from normal to severely depressed to morbid to ecstatically excited. He tends to come across as unstable and mentally different. He is in the habit of altering his mental state on a regular basis with self-psychosurgery, meaning that he often seems like a different person from week to week. He also has a habit of talking to his muse out loud, which is sometimes confusing to those around him.

Dr. Mindfuck acquired a remade morph on the cheap, due to it suffering from defective design (the Low Pain Tolerance trait).

After the Fall, Leclerc obtained a measure of success as an art critic in Elysium for several years. Eventually, however, he grew fed up with the casual dismissal of his criticism due to his uplift status and decided to move to a location where he’d be appreciated. His attempts to secure a travel visa and egocast to Titan were repeatedly rejected, however, so with careful deliberation he undertook a course of action that he was sure would get him kicked out of the Consortium. In a live broadcast, he unleashed a savage, scathing, and personal critique of the the sixteen most reputable fashion designers on Mars. Instead of being booted to the outer system, he was stripped of citizenship and told he could go into cold storage until another polity accepted his asylum claim or he could go into exile on the scum shuttle that was leaving to return to the Stars that afternoon. He chose exile to the swarm.

To his surprise, Leclerc found that he enjoys the riot of creativity among the scum. Even more importantly, he sees actual appreciation for the critical feedback he offers. Joining up with the Nature’s Rejects collective, he spends most of his time aboard Dayuejin, typically working with numerous artistically-minded peers to shape the creative output of the flotilla. Among the swarm’s uplifts, he is seen as a grandfatherly  figure, always ready with a quip and sordid tale to illustrate his life’s lessons.","Despite his reputation as a fierce critic, in person Leclerc comes off as warm and almost grandfatherly, offering gentle suggestions and always coming off as an attentive listener.

Hired by Provolve, she found herself the unwilling poster child of a PR campaign by the hypercorp to increase their reputation in the uplift community. Unfortunately, she was deeply unhappy at her work since she felt like she was seldom permitted to do any real research and spent most of her time at press events. She was also constantly surveiled by an Oversight handler who made sure she didn’t do or say anything that might portray Provolve or the Consortium in a negative light.

During a press junket on Erato, Jane decided she’d had enough and slipped her handler. Unsure of what to do next, she ran into a group of scum from Stars and blurted out her plight. Sympathetic, they sneaked her aboard the swarm. Over the next few weeks, Jane made herself useful by healing a number of small medical complaints aboard Three Sheets to the Wind and rapidly gained reputation. Recently, she was invited aboard The Stars Our Destination itself and given the codes for the medical and research facilities, since there were few others in the flotilla who could make good use of them.","Jane still feels like she has to prove her usefulness to the swarm and does anything she can to help out in a given situation. However, she is ercely protective of her privacy and has a curtained-off area at the back of the Stars medical bay that she has requested no one else go in to.

When the strike was called and the EDF anarchists revealed themselves, Singh threw in with the strikers, locked down the barracks where most of the security personnel were resting, and opened up the armory to the workers.

After the Fall, Singh stuck with the swarm and helped the fleet organize its militia. To this day, he has a hand in securing the fleet’s defenses, working alongside several weapon system collectives and training new militia volunteers. He also consults with conflict-resolution affinity groups that are formed by the scum on an ad-hoc basis to deal with disputes and antisocial crimes. He also secretly coordinates a counter-intelligence operation against outside groups and factions that meddle in the swarm’s affairs.","Singh has a keen sense of what is fair and does his best to mediate any situations aboard the fleet.

She found to her dismay, however, that working for a Ukrainian university meant also working for the oligarchs who pumped money into the institution to use it as a research facility for their own projects.

When the Fall began, those same oligarchs  ed the planet using nanoschematics of her design to modify a number of older launch vehicles on the pad for the capacity to reach Luna—but stranding her and the rest of her team. Lena and her colleagues managed to get another craft off planet, but the engines failed before they could reach a stable orbit and they began falling back towards Earth. A team of HAL strikers and scum swept in and rescued them, earning her eternal gratitude and her considerable skill in patching up busted systems. She immediately turned her skills towards improving and retrofitting the HAL facility. Since the swarm departed Earth, her attention has been focused unceasingly on getting the most out of the Thoughtcrime’s aging manufactories.

Lena’s loyalty is to her friends in the flotilla, and while she personally doesn’t consider herself much of an anarchist or even a real scum, she still considers the swarm her home and the people there her family. She maintains good relationships with the argonauts and often does small favors for them at inner system habitats at which the fleet stops over.","Lena’s personality can be a bit grating since she spends most of her time with machines and her fellow gear-heads and she is prone to snapping orders at whoever is nearby when some- thing needs to be done.

Lena spends most of her time clomping around in her arachnoid shell since she likes the functionality it gives her for tackling any engineering tasks or problems that might arise.

Because of this, her arachnoid shell is banged up and dented all over, although some of the other crew of the Thoughtcrime have tried to cover this up with colorful applications of paint to her chassis.","COG:30, COO:20, INT:20, REF:20, SAV:10, SOM:20, WIL:15, MOX:4, SPD:1, DUR:40",,"Fray 50, Free Fall 40, Hardware: Aerospace 65, Hardware: Electronics 65, Hardware: Industrial 50, Hardware: Nanotechnology 80, Interfacing 65, Investigation 60, Networking: Argonauts 40, Networking: Scientists 65, Perception 50, Programming 75 (Nanofabrication), Research 65, Academics: Materials Engineering 70, Academics: Nanofabrication 90, Language: Russian 50, Language: Ukrainian 90, Profession: Academic 45, Profession: Engineer 55 ",,Arachnoid,,,"Access Jacks, Basic Mesh Inserts, Cortical Stack, Cyberbrain, Eidetic Memory, Enhanced Vision, Extra Limbs: 10 Arms/Legs, Hyper Linguist, Lidar, Math Boost, Mnemonic Augmentation, Multitasking, Pneumatic Limbs, Nanophages, Radar",,"Creepy, Fabber, Mobile Lab, Nanodetector, Engineer Swarm, Guardian Swarm, Repair Spray, Servitor, Specimen Container",,,,,
Daniel Oliver,,,Infugee combat hacker,Night Cartel,"+Stability, +Conspiracy Theories, -Indenture","If you consider the secret Jovian base on Luna, the whole theory makes perfect sense.","Daniel Oliver is nominally employed as a security consultant for Anthony’s import/export business, but he frequently serves as a combat hacker for hits and espionage jobs. Like Miriam, he’s deep in debt to Anthony for the exotic array of software and Infomorph upgrades that help him do his work.

Many believe believe he “lives” on a high security server in Anthony’s private network. That entity is actually a decoy fork—what Daniel considers his “true self” resides on a hidden ghostrider module in Tess WIley’s morph. The two run high-risk info theft jobs for Anthony, as well as the occasional third party. They work together like well-oiled machine. Many people know the two are friends, some know they work together, but only a small handful know about the ghostrider module.","Daniel is an illegal beta fork of Caleb Reis, Tess Wiley’s father. He worked as a combat hacker and network security specialist during the Fall, holding o  TITAN attacks at key farcasting facilities during the evacuation of Earth. Nine Lives recovered his ego backup from a forgotten data cache in Earth Orbit, then created a large pool of forks to rent out as slave-hackers once they discovered his skills.

He’s not aware of this past, though, and all memories of his life before working in the Nine Lives info-mill have been wiped out. As far as he knows, Tess “freed” him during an info theft job at a Nine Lives facility, and they’r enow working to jointly pay off the debt. It’s a better deal than he’d have gotten from Nine Lives, obviously.

Daniel knows he’s good at what he does, but also understands that he’s crippled. His core aptitudes and skills were pruned in the forking process, and despite his missing memories he understands that his “real” self must have been the best of the best. It gnaws at him, and he’s prone to showing off. He projects a disaffected, “I’m just here for a good time” vibe, but when he’s working it’s clear that he takes his job very, very seriously.

He takes risks, often foolish ones, and he’s prone to paranoia and conspiracy theories—especially when he suspects that his missing memories or skills might have been important for a job. His only personal confidant is Tess, who keeps him at arms length despite their close working relationship.","COG:30, COO:5, INT:15, REF:5, SAV:20, SOM:5, WIL:10, MOX:1, SPD:3, DUR:35","Beta, Edited Memories, Mental Disorder: Impulse Control, Digital Ghost, Intuitive Cracker","Deception 55, Hardware: Electronics 50, Gunnery 40, Infosec 60, Interfacing 60, Investigation 60, Kinesics 25, Navigation 35, Networking: Criminals 45, Networking: Hypercorps 40, Perception 55, Pilot: Aircraft 35, Pilot: Spacecraft 40, Programming 60, Research 60, Academics: Computer Science 60, Academics: Cryptography 60, Interest: Criminal Groups 40, Interest: Peaty Scotch 45, Language: English 60, Professional: Data Mining 60, Professional: Mesh Security Ops 60",,Sage,,,"Eidetic Memory, Hyper Linguist, Math Boost, Mnemonic Augmentation, Active Countermeasures","Daniel is an infomorph, and his usual AR avatar is a scruffy eastern european male.

Tess Wiley,,,Bohemian blackmailer,Night Cartel,"+Self Reliance, +Family Unity, -Debt","Darling, you positively MUST.","Tess is a social butterfly trying to keep Whiskey’s inexplicable live theater community from evaporating: the local market is slim, but the group scrapes by selling well-reviewed XP recordings of their productions. She’s always on the lookout for patrons and publicity, but it’s a mystery why she’s trying to make it on Whiskey rather than move to the inner system.

To those in the know, she’s also a cat’s paw for Anthony Gillotti, Whiskey’s resident smuggler and power broker. Gillotti keeps her theater’s lights on, and she wines and dines his guests. While she does, she gathers blackmail material, plants backdoors, and acts as a discreet messenger. Her quick command of social situations and her reputation as a broke bohemian artist are o en enough to get her out of tricky situations.","Tess’s real name is “Miriam Reis.” Her father, Caleb Reis, was a network security specialist protecting one of Chicago’s last farcasters from constant TITAN hacks. When his wife was killed in an attack, he pulled strings to secure his 19-year-old daughter time to ego-cast off planet. Miriam spent years doing scut work on Luna and Mars, occasionally using her UofC theater training. She remained convinced that her father made it off Earth.

Four years ago, she followed a lead on a Main Belt data storage facility that may have received Caleb’s uploaded ego before Chicago was destroyed. It turned out to be a cover for a Nine Lives forknapping ring, and several memory- wiped Beta Forks of Caleb were being rented out as a mesh intrusion team. She called in every favor, burnt every last bit of rep, and went deep into debt to orchestrate a jailbreak—convincing the sponsors it would be a lucrative heist.

She and the team she hired rescued one of the forks and burnt the Nine Lives network housing the backups. As a result of the rescue, she’s on Nine Lives’ shit list and is deeper in debt to Anthony Gillotti than she’ll ever be able to repay. Fortunately, she and Caleb — now ‘Daniel’ — are useful enough that he helps protect them.

Tess is fiercely protective of Daniel, but tries hard to remain distant: she secretly hopes to find the original backup that his memory-wiped fork was created from. If that happens, she knows that Daniel might have to be sacrificed.","COG:15, COO:20, INT:15, REF:15, SAV:30, SOM:15, WIL:20, MOX:3, SPD:1, DUR:35","Dependent, Intense Relationship:Caleb Reis, Information Control, Debt (Level 3), On The Run:Nine Lives","Deception 60, Exotic Melee Weapon: Monowire Garotte 60, Fray 65, Free Fall 60, Impersonation 30, Infiltration 70, Kinesics 55, Networking (Autonomists) 30, Networking (Criminals) 65, Networking (Media) 40, Palming 55, Perception 65, Persuasion 60, Protocol 50, Unarmed Combat 50, Academics: Film History 30, Art: Performance 45, Art: Theater Production 55, Interest: Celebrity Gossip 65, Interest: Wine 55, Language: English 85, Language: Mandarin 45, Professional: Social Engineering 45",,Sylph,,Striking Looks,"Access Jacks, Basic Mesh Inserts, Cortical Stack, Basic Biomods, Clean Metabolism, Enhanced Pheromones, Enhanced Smell, Holographic Projector, Endocrine Control, Ghostrider Module, Puppet Sock, Bioware Claws","Tall and lithe, with a thick head of raven curls and a sly smirk.

Anthony Gillotti,,,Smuggling Mastermind,Night Cartel,"+Human Survival, +Earth Relics, -TITANs",I believe you’ll need to speak to my associates about that.,"Anthony makes a show of owning a high-end pawnshop on Whiskey, stocked with a fortune in Earth relics. It’s unclear how much money he has, but he wines and dines Hypercorp visitors and representatives from various factions quite frequently. He even funds most of Whiskey’s improbably local arts scene.

He insists that “imports and exports” are his primary business, but everyone knows that his associates “protect” half of the outer ring. He’s helped keep Whiskey relatively peaceful, but those who cross him have “accidents” with alarming frequency. If you need to move dangerous or exotic artifacts, even contraband from a Gatecrashing mission, contacting him is a good first step.

Anthony established himself as a reliable, if somewhat disinterested, middleman in the pre-fall Mafia networks on Earth. During the evacuation, however, he kicked into high gear and took control of several disintegrating criminal gangs. He and his associates made it to the outer systems with a fortune in looted Earth antiques, which Anthony used as collateral to establish himself on Whiskey. Since then he’s consolidated his power and set himself up as a middleman.","After a Jovian strike team nearly killed him several years ago, Anthony uses a heavily modified Guard Deluxe morph. Its Synthetic Mask augmentation mimics the appearance of his previous Splicer morph (-30 to detect the difference), and only his inner circle know of the change. The downside of his juiced up morph is a tendency to overheat: his offices and personal quarters are kept at a chilly 15C.

His personal guards are Michael and Gabriel, a pair of well-dressed Criminal Enforcers (NPC File Prime, page 7). They’re linked to his private TacNet along with a number of trusted lieutenants, and accompany him whenever he’s outside his private quarters.

Anthony is funneling the vast majority of his wealth into a black project: establishing a self-sufiicient colony in a distant habitable system, then cutting it off from transhumanity. He believes that Sol is doomed, and this “lifeboat” will be humanity’s last shot. A handful of close associates know small parts of the plan (he smuggles shipments through the Eros gate, his wealth is being siphoned off of Whiskey, etc), but not the big picture. 

Anthony is collected, hard to ruffle, and willing to dig out a cortical stack with his hands if it needs to be done. He can be cordial, even charming, and makes a show of “old-world” manners. He considers unnecessary violence a sign of weakness. Many think his interest in the arts is a way of flaunting his wealth, but it’s genuine, and reflects his desire to save “the best of us.”","COG:15, COO:20, INT:15, REF:20, SAV:20, SOM:20, WIL:25, MOX:3, SPD:2, DUR:50","Stalker:Obsessive journalist Alice Young, Black Mark: Double-crossed Jovian government","Beam Weapons 55, Deception 50, Fray 60, Intimidation 70, Kinesics 60, Networking: Autonomists 50, Networking: Criminals 85, Networking: Ecologists 50, Networking: Hypercorps 50, Networking: Scientists 55, Palming 50, Perception 65, Persuasion 70, Unarmed Combat 45, Interest: Opera 45, Interest: Antiques 55, Interest: Church History 60, Interest: Criminal Groups 60, Language: English 85, Language: Italian 55, Profession: Antiques Dealer 55, Profession: Smuggler 60",,Guard Deluxe,,Temperature Intolerance,"Access Jacks, Basic Mesh Inserts, Cortical Stack, Brain Box, Chemical Sniffer, Enhanced Vision, T-Ray Emitter, Lidar, Synthetic Mask, Neurachem (Level 1), Cyberclaws, Concealed Weapon Mount","A tall man in his mid-fifties with greying hair, a slight limp, and bit of weight around the middle.
