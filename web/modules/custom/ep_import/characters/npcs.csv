Dora Mendoza,,MYE.22,Re-Instantiated,Scum,,,"There was a time when you thought of yourself as one of the good guys. That was rather precious.

You started your career in Firewall the way a lot of people do: some crazy person with ambitions to save the universe came up to you after something weird happened and convinced you that it’d be a great idea to help other people for a while. And for a while, you did.

Then you met Fern. You’d always been good with information security, but Fern was better—better than you could ever hope to be. Moreover, Fern wasn’t an AGI. Fern is human.

You met because you were on a run for Firewall, trying to track down the power behind a ring on Venus that was implanting black market neural transmitters in people to record their experiences and make illegal simulspace playbacks. Fern tracked you back, broke into your personal system, and told you what was what.

Humanity was stuck. Not evolving. People like Firewall and the Planetary Consortium were holding it back.","Fern has promised to teach you some of its skills (it’s neither a he nor she as far as you can tell), but you need to do a little tit-for-tat. Firewall comes across all kinds of things that are interesting to Fern, and you gather them, lovingly, sift through what is there, and package them up for your patron. Fern’s kindnesses have been revelatory: new vistas on the datasphere, new ways of assimilating augmented reality into your perception. But they’ve always been fleeting, tantalizing. You want the full monty.

It’s known in Firewall that you don’t have a stack and refuse to egocast. You’ve always been able to explain this as a religious objection.

Living in a world full of people who think they’re immortal is weird.

You were part of a team that went through the Pandora Gate to investigate Iktomi ruins on an exoplanet called Braddingskord II. Your team found an Iktomi artifact that appeared to be a computational device of some type—a source of much excitement—and set out to perform a field analysis. Within hours of beginning the analysis, one of the team’s computational archaeologists had gone mad, and had apparently infected one of your teammates with the same madness through sexual contact. The infected teammate disappeared from camp and began stalking your team through the Iktomi ruins, killing you one by one. In the end only you and Tara Yu, another computational archaeologist, remained. Together, you managed to stop the infected team member. Yu, a professor at Titan Autonomous University, explained that she was an agent of Firewall. She liked how you handled yourself and invited you to join.

When you returned to Titan, some agents of the state intelligence agency approached you. They explained some of Firewall’s activities to you—including occasionally killing its own agents and innocent civilians to suppress TITAN activity.

Most of your peers grew up to be catatonic vegetables, suicidal depressives, or sociopathic monsters. Through some freak stroke of luck, you’re (mostly) normal, but because of how your crèche mates turned out, fear, pity, and mistrust are common reactions among people who find out who you are.

You started looking for people who didn’t want to be found. You were good at it, and nobody seemed much bothered by the fact that you were Lost, as long as you got the job done. Then you started getting some really weird jobs. Turned out you were working for Firewall. After dealing with an exsurgent-infected mother who was having kids and then eating them so that she could feast on their psychic trauma, and a cult who thought they could fuse souls by sewing people together, you got the idea that Firewall’s mission was pretty important. The TITANs are gone, but their legacy sews madness and destruction wherever it rears its head. Firewall isn’t exactly the family you always wanted, but it’s a cause to give your life purpose and, for now, that’s good enough.","You watched most of the kids you grew up with go out of their minds shortly after being sleeved, and fear this might someday happen to you has been a constant in your life, as well. When they finally decided to risk sleeving you, they kept you under observation for months.

The first time you met your parents in the flesh, you could see in their eyes that they weren’t sure whether the daughter they’d ordered up was a happy accident amid a string of calamities or just another freak show put together from the memories of a simulspace avatar and some up-market vat meat. This despite years of visits, e-mails from Mom at work, afternoons playing catch with Dad in a simulspace park. Even when you all started going crazy and they limited contact with your parents out in the real world, you felt like they were out there for you. But then, with you out, breathing, in the real world, you suddenly felt like they’d just been raising an expensive video game character in their off hours, and now they weren’t so sure what they’d ended up with.

You don’t blame them. You’ve told a few select con - dants over time that you don’t blame them, and no one ever believes you. How could you not be angry at their rejection? Well, you just aren’t.

She spent several years in prison under horrific conditions before being liberated during the conflicts that preceded the Fall. While many of the other old collective members have moved on to pursue other interests, Alice has remained with EDF and the swarm. Along with Singh and Andropov, she has become a respected voice of wisdom in the fleet. She is often delegated the responsibility of dealing with outside authorities on behalf of the fleet—primarily because she is one of the few EDF members who can talk to hypercorp and socialite elites at length without totally losing her shit.","Despite often being placed in a spokes-person/delegate role, Alice is very concerned about being perceived as a leader. She takes care not to act in any way that hasn’t been authorized by a collective or swarm decision. Given her prominent stature, she tends to excuse herself from much of the EDF’s anti-Consortium subversive activities for better deniability. Her primary concern is the health and safety of the fleet—she is acutely aware of the various threats to the swarm, both internal and external. Alice still occasionally suffers PTSD from her time in prison, though she is quite adept at hiding this from prying eyes.

A rebellious kid with a knack for computers, she has grown to become a skilled infosec specialist and programmer. Along with a few other hackers in the swarm, she has been involved in various Decepticon (p. 46, Panopticon) projects that aim to seed mesh networks around the inner system with false data.

Through the Decepticon network, Amrita was recruited into Firewall two years ago. Her skills were needed to help cover the tracks of a sentinel team active on Venus. During this time she learned about a potential TITAN threat that lingered in the Venusian cloud layer and has over time been brought up to speed on other affairs, like the exsurgent virus and the existence of asyncs. She combines her extracurricular activities, seeding data via the Decepticons in a way that helps to conceal the existence of things that Firewall would prefer to remain unknown to the public.

Hacking is not Amrita’s only specialty: she also sidelines as a porn XP star and producer. Her attractive four-armed bouncer morph is a common sight in the many porn sims and playback recordings the swarm produces. She peddles the XP she produces around the inner system, using it as currency and bribes to support her hacktivism endeavors.","Amrita is young and excitable. She is really engaged in her work with the Decepticons, making it a point to spread disinformation at every habitat the swarm visits. The porn biz is more her recreational activity than a side gig—something she enjoys doing and which just happens to support her other projects. She is unsure what to make of Firewall. Though she gets the importance of it, the scope of the secrets and x-risks sometimes exceed her ability to process and comprehend.

She was seven when the Fall happened and barely remembers it, some- times getting annoyed at the others around her who dwell on the event and refuse to move on. While she didn’t grow up in the Stars swarm, she was raised on another scum  eet in the Jupiter system and finds the Stars scum to be a bit more buttoned down and staid than her home flotilla.

Barking Dog has made quite a reputation for herself with the Dogonauts by using her contacts to score the newest and hottest mind-altering substances from her outer system scum contacts. She often seeks out new faces on the swarm—travelers and tourists— in the hopes of getting them high and hearing their stories.

While she’ll readily promise to get any substance for anybody, she often forgets and has started to develop a reputation for being flaky.

Dog is sleeved in a sylph morph she managed to score from someone passing through the swarm.

Doctor Mindfuck,,SOD.11,Neurodivergent Psychosurgeon,Scum,"+Recreational Psychosurgery, +Drug Use, –Informal Hierarchies",,"Dr. Boris Simic was a well-off psychosurgeon working for the Serbian government. Specifically employed as a loyalty tester, he gained an incredible amount of insight into the inner thoughts of bureaucrats and career politicos. When TITAN nanoviruses hit Eastern Europe, he was reassigned to help government of cials who had contracted mind-altering infections. In the course of his work, Simic fell victim to one of these plagues, suffering from severe mood swings. Considered a liability, he was ineligible for evacuation. Betrayed by his own government, Simic managed to bribe his way on board a refugee shuttle that barely made it into orbit. Rescued by HAL strikers, Simic stayed with the refugees when the swarm departed Earth.

Simic adopted well to the scum lifestyle, engaging in heavy petal use as a way of coping with his traumatic experiences and letting go of many of his former inhibitions. He quickly turned his talents towards experimental procedures and offered his services to anyone desiring a recreational mental alteration. Though his attempts to counter his own neurological damage have failed—and may even have exacerbated his condition—there is no question that he is skilled at shaping minds. Many scum make regular trips to his offices, seeking new mind-sets, new outlooks on life, or just a new type of trip. Over the years, Simic adopted the nickname many of the scum were using for him, and now introduces himself as Dr. Mindfuck to everyone he meets.

In recent years, Dr. Mindfuck has become an outspoken critic of the EDF and Alice Chu. He consistently calls them out as the “hidden leadership” and “secret elites” of the fleet, noting the similarities to the mindsets of the many bureaucrats and politicos he dealt with in the past. Though he has few close friends and is not part of a collective, Dr. Mindfuck has earned some respect and allies for his outspoken-ness. Some of these supporters see actual wisdom in his critiques, while others just see him as a useful tool in the political dynamics of the fleet.","Dr. Mindfuck’s susceptibility to mood swings makes him an interesting person to be around—he quite suddenly can go from normal to severely depressed to morbid to ecstatically excited. He tends to come across as unstable and mentally different. He is in the habit of altering his mental state on a regular basis with self-psychosurgery, meaning that he often seems like a different person from week to week. He also has a habit of talking to his muse out loud, which is sometimes confusing to those around him.

Dr. Mindfuck acquired a remade morph on the cheap, due to it suffering from defective design (the Low Pain Tolerance trait).

After the Fall, Leclerc obtained a measure of success as an art critic in Elysium for several years. Eventually, however, he grew fed up with the casual dismissal of his criticism due to his uplift status and decided to move to a location where he’d be appreciated. His attempts to secure a travel visa and egocast to Titan were repeatedly rejected, however, so with careful deliberation he undertook a course of action that he was sure would get him kicked out of the Consortium. In a live broadcast, he unleashed a savage, scathing, and personal critique of the the sixteen most reputable fashion designers on Mars. Instead of being booted to the outer system, he was stripped of citizenship and told he could go into cold storage until another polity accepted his asylum claim or he could go into exile on the scum shuttle that was leaving to return to the Stars that afternoon. He chose exile to the swarm.

To his surprise, Leclerc found that he enjoys the riot of creativity among the scum. Even more importantly, he sees actual appreciation for the critical feedback he offers. Joining up with the Nature’s Rejects collective, he spends most of his time aboard Dayuejin, typically working with numerous artistically-minded peers to shape the creative output of the flotilla. Among the swarm’s uplifts, he is seen as a grandfatherly  figure, always ready with a quip and sordid tale to illustrate his life’s lessons.","Despite his reputation as a fierce critic, in person Leclerc comes off as warm and almost grandfatherly, offering gentle suggestions and always coming off as an attentive listener.

Hired by Provolve, she found herself the unwilling poster child of a PR campaign by the hypercorp to increase their reputation in the uplift community. Unfortunately, she was deeply unhappy at her work since she felt like she was seldom permitted to do any real research and spent most of her time at press events. She was also constantly surveiled by an Oversight handler who made sure she didn’t do or say anything that might portray Provolve or the Consortium in a negative light.

During a press junket on Erato, Jane decided she’d had enough and slipped her handler. Unsure of what to do next, she ran into a group of scum from Stars and blurted out her plight. Sympathetic, they sneaked her aboard the swarm. Over the next few weeks, Jane made herself useful by healing a number of small medical complaints aboard Three Sheets to the Wind and rapidly gained reputation. Recently, she was invited aboard The Stars Our Destination itself and given the codes for the medical and research facilities, since there were few others in the flotilla who could make good use of them.","Jane still feels like she has to prove her usefulness to the swarm and does anything she can to help out in a given situation.

When the strike was called and the EDF anarchists revealed themselves, Singh threw in with the strikers, locked down the barracks where most of the security personnel were resting, and opened up the armory to the workers.

After the Fall, Singh stuck with the swarm and helped the fleet organize its militia. To this day, he has a hand in securing the fleet’s defenses, working alongside several weapon system collectives and training new militia volunteers. He also consults with conflict-resolution affinity groups that are formed by the scum on an ad-hoc basis to deal with disputes and antisocial crimes. He also secretly coordinates a counter-intelligence operation against outside groups and factions that meddle in the swarm’s affairs.","Singh has a keen sense of what is fair and does his best to mediate any situations aboard the fleet.

She found to her dismay, however, that working for a Ukrainian university meant also working for the oligarchs who pumped money into the institution to use it as a research facility for their own projects.

When the Fall began, those same oligarchs  ed the planet using nanoschematics of her design to modify a number of older launch vehicles on the pad for the capacity to reach Luna—but stranding her and the rest of her team. Lena and her colleagues managed to get another craft off planet, but the engines failed before they could reach a stable orbit and they began falling back towards Earth. A team of HAL strikers and scum swept in and rescued them, earning her eternal gratitude and her considerable skill in patching up busted systems. She immediately turned her skills towards improving and retrofitting the HAL facility. Since the swarm departed Earth, her attention has been focused unceasingly on getting the most out of the Thoughtcrime’s aging manufactories.

Lena’s loyalty is to her friends in the flotilla, and while she personally doesn’t consider herself much of an anarchist or even a real scum, she still considers the swarm her home and the people there her family. She maintains good relationships with the argonauts and often does small favors for them at inner system habitats at which the fleet stops over.","Lena’s personality can be a bit grating since she spends most of her time with machines and her fellow gear-heads and she is prone to snapping orders at whoever is nearby when some- thing needs to be done.

Lena spends most of her time clomping around in her arachnoid shell since she likes the functionality it gives her for tackling any engineering tasks or problems that might arise. She’s a hands-on type of woman and won’t hesitate to clamber all over the outside hull of a ship that’s experiencing problems.

He’s gracious and confident, given to expansive gestures when he’s talking.

Anthony presents as an aging mafia don; his presence is intimidating, but he doesn’t look like a bruiser. Successful Kinesics checks will reveal that he’s a lot more limber than he looks, however. The weight around the middle is body armor, and the limp disappears when he really needs to move.

Anthony makes a show of owning a high-end pawnshop on Whiskey, stocked with a fortune in Earth relics. It’s unclear how much money he has, but he wines and dines Hypercorp visitors and representatives from various factions quite frequently. He even funds most of Whiskey’s improbably local arts scene.

He insists that “imports and exports” are his primary business, but everyone knows that his associates “protect” half of the outer ring. He’s helped keep Whiskey relatively peaceful, but those who cross him have “accidents” with alarming frequency. If you need to move dangerous or exotic artifacts, even contraband from a Gatecrashing mission, contacting him is a good first step.","Anthony established himself as a reliable, if somewhat disinterested, middleman in the pre-fall Mafia networks on Earth. During the evacuation, however, he kicked into high gear and took control of several disintegrating criminal gangs. He and his associates made it to the outer systems with a fortune in looted Earth antiques, which Anthony used as collateral to establish himself on Whiskey. Since then he’s consolidated his power and set himself up as a middleman. 

After a Jovian strike team nearly killed him several years ago, Anthony uses a heavily modified Guard Deluxe morph. Its Synthetic Mask augmentation mimics the appearance of his previous Splicer morph (-30 to detect the difference), and only his inner circle know of the change. The downside of his juiced up morph is a tendency to overheat: his offices and personal quarters are kept at a chilly 15C.

His personal guards are Michael and Gabriel, a pair of well-dressed Criminal Enforcers (NPC File Prime, page 7). They’re linked to his private TacNet along with a number of trusted lieutenants, and accompany him whenever he’s outside his private quarters.

Anthony is funneling the vast majority of his wealth into a black project: establishing a self-sufiicient colony in a distant habitable system, then cutting it off from transhumanity. He believes that Sol is doomed, and this “lifeboat” will be humanity’s last shot. A handful of close associates know small parts of the plan (he smuggles shipments through the Eros gate, his wealth is being siphoned off of Whiskey, etc), but not the big picture. 

Anthony is collected, hard to ruffle, and willing to dig out a cortical stack with his hands if it needs to be done. He can be cordial, even charming, and makes a show of “old-world” manners. He considers unnecessary violence a sign of weakness.

However, he’s also been known to appear in meetings as an over-the-top pigtailed anime character in the Moé or Waifu style. Given his fondness for burner Ectos and fabricated mesh IDs even during casual interactions, odds are good that any resident of Whiskey has interacted with Daniel without realizing it.

Daniel Oliver is nominally employed as a security consultant for Anthony’s import/export business, but he frequently serves as a combat hacker for hits and espionage jobs. Like Miriam, he’s deep in debt to Anthony for the exotic array of software and Infomorph upgrades that help him do his work.

Many believe believe he “lives” on a high security server in Anthony’s private network. That entity is actually a decoy fork—what Daniel considers his “true self” resides on a hidden ghostrider module in Tess WIley’s morph. The two run high-risk info theft jobs for Anthony, as well as the occasional third party. They work together like well-oiled machine. Many people know the two are friends, some know they work together, but only a small handful know about the ghostrider module.","Daniel is an illegal beta fork of Caleb Reis, Tess Wiley’s father. He worked as a combat hacker and network security specialist during the Fall, holding o  TITAN attacks at key farcasting facilities during the evacuation of Earth. Nine Lives recovered his ego backup from a forgotten data cache in Earth Orbit, then created a large pool of forks to rent out as slave-hackers once they discovered his skills.

He’s not aware of this past, though, and all memories of his life before working in the Nine Lives info-mill have been wiped out. As far as he knows, Tess “freed” him during an info theft job at a Nine Lives facility, and they’r enow working to jointly pay off the debt. It’s a better deal than he’d have gotten from Nine Lives, obviously.

Daniel knows he’s good at what he does, but also understands that he’s crippled. His core aptitudes and skills were pruned in the forking process, and despite his missing memories he understands that his “real” self must have been the best of the best. It gnaws at him, and he’s prone to showing off. He projects a disaffected, “I’m just here for a good time” vibe, but when he’s working it’s clear that he takes his job very, very seriously.

He takes risks, often foolish ones, and he’s prone to paranoia and conspiracy theories—especially when he suspects that his missing memories or skills might have been important for a job.

If she thinks someone’s bullshitting her, she’ll arch an eyebrow, listen, and keep feeding them rope. Her morph sports a holographic projector meant to enhance her appearance with impressive environmental effects, but she often abuses during conversations. If she disagrees with someone, they’ll probably find biting commentary floating overhead while they’re talking.

Tess is a social butterfly trying to keep Whiskey’s inexplicable live theater community from evaporating: the local market is slim, but the group scrapes by selling well-reviewed XP recordings of their productions. She’s always on the lookout for patrons and publicity, but it’s a mystery why she’s trying to make it on Whiskey rather than move to the inner system.

To those in the know, she’s also a cat’s paw for Anthony Gillotti, Whiskey’s resident smuggler and power broker. Gillotti keeps her theater’s lights on, and she wines and dines his guests. While she does, she gathers blackmail material, plants backdoors, and acts as a discreet messenger. Her quick command of social situations and her reputation as a broke bohemian artist are o en enough to get her out of tricky situations.","Tess’s real name is “Miriam Reis.” Her father, Caleb Reis, was a network security specialist protecting one of Chicago’s last farcasters from constant TITAN hacks. When his wife was killed in an attack, he pulled strings to secure his 19-year-old daughter time to ego-cast off planet. Miriam spent years doing scut work on Luna and Mars, occasionally using her UofC theater training. She remained convinced that her father made it off Earth.

Four years ago, she followed a lead on a Main Belt data storage facility that may have received Caleb’s uploaded ego before Chicago was destroyed. It turned out to be a cover for a Nine Lives forknapping ring, and several memory- wiped Beta Forks of Caleb were being rented out as a mesh intrusion team. She called in every favor, burnt every last bit of rep, and went deep into debt to orchestrate a jailbreak—convincing the sponsors it would be a lucrative heist.

She and the team she hired rescued one of the forks and burnt the Nine Lives network housing the backups. As a result of the rescue, she’s on Nine Lives’ shit list and is deeper in debt to Anthony Gillotti than she’ll ever be able to repay. Fortunately, she and Caleb — now ‘Daniel’ — are useful enough that he helps protect them.

Tess is fiercely protective of Daniel, but tries hard to remain distant: she secretly hopes to find the original backup that his memory-wiped fork was created from. If that happens, she knows that Daniel might have to be sacrificed.","COG:15, COO:15, INT:15, REF:15, SAV:20, SOM:15, WIL:15, MOX:3, SPD:1","Dependent, Intense Relationship:Caleb Reis, Information Control, Debt (Level 3), On The Run:Nine Lives","Deception 60, Exotic Melee Weapon: Monowire Garotte 60, Fray 65, Free Fall 60, Impersonation 30, Infiltration 70, Kinesics 55, Networking 30 (Autonomists), Networking (Criminals) 65, Networking 40 (Media), Palming 55, Perception 65, Persuasion 60, Protocol 50, Unarmed Combat 50, Academics: Film History 30, Art: Performance 45, Art: Theater Production 55, Interest: Celebrity Gossip 65, Interest: Wine 55, Language: English 85, Language: Mandarin 45, Professional: Social Engineering 45",,Sylph,"COO:5, SAV:10, WIL:5, DUR:35",Striking Looks,"Access Jacks, Basic Mesh Inserts, Cortical Stack, Basic Biomods, Clean Metabolism, Enhanced Pheromones, Enhanced Smell, Holographic Projector, Endocrine Control, Ghostrider Module, Puppet Sock, Bioware Claws",,"Smart Cat: Neko, Tactical Network, Active ID Protection, Prisoner Mask",Bioware Claws; Monowire Garrote,Smart Clothing,,,"@:5,f:35,g:10",TRUE,
