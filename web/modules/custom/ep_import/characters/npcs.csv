Silvestri’s splicer is reasonably attractive but merely plain by the standards of Parvarti.

Of course, he’s also a pragmatic old bird, so he hedges his bets by letting the Cartel know about the player characters as well. Blackvein knows that most inner system inhabitants are put off by mercurials so he plays up the “caged bird” stereotype by flitting from perch to perch in his meeting room, never standing still, and often flying quite close to the character’ heads.

Blackvein stands approximately one meter tall and has decorated his jet black plumage with nano-dyes that cascade in iridescent colors across his wings and back.

She spent several years in prison under horrific conditions before being liberated during the conflicts that preceded the Fall. While many of the other old collective members have moved on to pursue other interests, Alice has remained with EDF and the swarm. Along with Singh and Andropov, she has become a respected voice of wisdom in the fleet. She is often delegated the responsibility of dealing with outside authorities on behalf of the fleet—primarily because she is one of the few EDF members who can talk to hypercorp and socialite elites at length without totally losing her shit.","Despite often being placed in a spokes-person/delegate role, Alice is very concerned about being perceived as a leader. She takes care not to act in any way that hasn’t been authorized by a collective or swarm decision.

Her primary concern is the health and safety of the fleet—she is acutely aware of the various threats to the swarm, both internal and external. Alice still occasionally suffers PTSD from her time in prison, though she is quite adept at hiding this from prying eyes.

Along with a few other hackers in the swarm, she has been involved in various Decepticon (p. 46, Panopticon) projects that aim to seed mesh networks around the inner system with false data.

Through the Decepticon network, Amrita was recruited into Firewall two years ago. Her skills were needed to help cover the tracks of a sentinel team active on Venus. During this time she learned about a potential TITAN threat that lingered in the Venusian cloud layer and has over time been brought up to speed on other affairs, like the exsurgent virus and the existence of asyncs. She combines her extracurricular activities, seeding data via the Decepticons in a way that helps to conceal the existence of things that Firewall would prefer to remain unknown to the public.

Hacking is not Amrita’s only specialty: she also sidelines as a porn XP star and producer. Her attractive four-armed bouncer morph is a common sight in the many porn sims and playback recordings the swarm produces. She peddles the XP she produces around the inner system, using it as currency and bribes to support her hacktivism endeavors.","Amrita is young and excitable. She is really engaged in her work with the Decepticons, making it a point to spread disinformation at every habitat the swarm visits. The porn biz is more her recreational activity than a side gig—something she enjoys doing and which just happens to support her other projects. She is unsure what to make of Firewall. Though she gets the importance of it, the scope of the secrets and x-risks sometimes exceed her ability to process and comprehend.

Amrita’s bouncer has an ethnic Indian look with an extra set of arms (cybernetic but masked). Most of her body is covered with intricate mehndi-style nanotattoos.","COG:15, COO:15, INT:20, REF:15, SAV:20, SOM:15, WIL:20, MOX:4, SPD:1, DUR:35",Bouncer,"45, Infiltration 55, Infosec 65, Investigation 40, Kinesics 40, Kinetic Weapons 45, Networking: Autonomists 35, Networking: Criminals 45, Networking: Firewall: 30, Perception 45, Programming 55, Research 65, Pornography 55, Language: Cantonese 40, Language: Hindi 90, Language: English 60, Professional: XP Production 55","Basic Biomods, Basic Mesh Inserts, Cortical Stack, Cyberlimbs: 2 with Synthetic Mask option, Grip Pads, Oxygen Reserve, Prehensile Feet, Prehensile Tail",Limber (Level 1),,,,,,,

She joined only three years ago and her ego is only seventeen years old. She was seven when the Fall happened and barely remembers it, some- times getting annoyed at the others around her who dwell on the event and refuse to move on. While she didn’t grow up in the Stars swarm, she was raised on another scum  eet in the Jupiter system and finds the Stars scum to be a bit more buttoned down and staid than her home flotilla.

Barking Dog has made quite a reputation for herself with the Dogonauts by using her contacts to score the newest and hottest mind-altering substances from her outer system scum contacts. She often seeks out new faces on the swarm—travelers and tourists— in the hopes of getting them high and hearing their stories. On a couple of occasions, Singh has convinced her to cozy up to outsiders and squeeze information out of them.","Barking Dog seems to have two personality modes. When she’s getting to know someone or trying to get a favor, she is attentive, flirtatious, and sensual. The rest of the time she comes off as a cocky kid who shows little respect to anyone and often seems only to be half paying attention to anyone speaking to her, likely because she is high. While she’ll readily promise to get any substance for anybody, she often forgets and has started to develop a reputation for being flaky.

Dog is sleeved in a sylph morph she managed to score from someone passing through the swarm. While the morph is undoubtedly beautiful, she has gone out of her way to heavily modify it with nanotats, piercings, and outrageously tacky clothing.

Doctor Mindfuck,,SOD.11,Neurodivergent Psychosurgeon,Scum,"+Recreational Psychosurgery, +Drug Use, –Informal Hierarchies",,"Dr. Boris Simic was a well-off psychosurgeon working for the Serbian government. Specifically employed as a loyalty tester, he gained an incredible amount of insight into the inner thoughts of bureaucrats and career politicos. When TITAN nanoviruses hit Eastern Europe, he was reassigned to help government of cials who had contracted mind-altering infections. In the course of his work, Simic fell victim to one of these plagues, suffering from severe mood swings. Considered a liability, he was ineligible for evacuation. Betrayed by his own government, Simic managed to bribe his way on board a refugee shuttle that barely made it into orbit. Rescued by HAL strikers, Simic stayed with the refugees when the swarm departed Earth.

Simic adopted well to the scum lifestyle, engaging in heavy petal use as a way of coping with his traumatic experiences and letting go of many of his former inhibitions. He quickly turned his talents towards experimental procedures and offered his services to anyone desiring a recreational mental alteration. Though his attempts to counter his own neurological damage have failed—and may even have exacerbated his condition—there is no question that he is skilled at shaping minds. Many scum make regular trips to his offices, seeking new mind-sets, new outlooks on life, or just a new type of trip. Over the years, Simic adopted the nickname many of the scum were using for him, and now introduces himself as Dr. Mindfuck to everyone he meets.

In recent years, Dr. Mindfuck has become an outspoken critic of the EDF and Alice Chu. He consistently calls them out as the “hidden leadership” and “secret elites” of the fleet, noting the similarities to the mindsets of the many bureaucrats and politicos he dealt with in the past. Though he has few close friends and is not part of a collective, Dr. Mindfuck has earned some respect and allies for his outspoken-ness. Some of these supporters see actual wisdom in his critiques, while others just see him as a useful tool in the political dynamics of the fleet.","Dr. Mindfuck’s susceptibility to mood swings makes him an interesting person to be around—he quite suddenly can go from normal to severely depressed to morbid to ecstatically excited. He tends to come across as unstable and mentally different. He is in the habit of altering his mental state on a regular basis with self-psychosurgery, meaning that he often seems like a different person from week to week. He also has a habit of talking to his muse out loud, which is sometimes confusing to those around him.

Dr. Mindfuck acquired a remade morph on the cheap, due to it suffering from defective design (the Low Pain Tolerance trait). He has covered his entire body in nanotattoos which constantly shift and evolve according to his moods.

After the Fall, Leclerc obtained a measure of success as an art critic in Elysium for several years. Eventually, however, he grew fed up with the casual dismissal of his criticism due to his uplift status and decided to move to a location where he’d be appreciated. His attempts to secure a travel visa and egocast to Titan were repeatedly rejected, however, so with careful deliberation he undertook a course of action that he was sure would get him kicked out of the Consortium. In a live broadcast, he unleashed a savage, scathing, and personal critique of the the sixteen most reputable fashion designers on Mars. Instead of being booted to the outer system, he was stripped of citizenship and told he could go into cold storage until another polity accepted his asylum claim or he could go into exile on the scum shuttle that was leaving to return to the Stars that afternoon. He chose exile to the swarm.

To his surprise, Leclerc found that he enjoys the riot of creativity among the scum. Even more importantly, he sees actual appreciation for the critical feedback he offers. Joining up with the Nature’s Rejects collective, he spends most of his time aboard Dayuejin, typically working with numerous artistically-minded peers to shape the creative output of the flotilla. Among the swarm’s uplifts, he is seen as a grandfatherly  figure, always ready with a quip and sordid tale to illustrate his life’s lessons.","Despite his reputation as a fierce critic, in person Leclerc comes off as warm and almost grandfatherly, offering gentle suggestions and always coming off as an attentive listener.

Hired by Provolve, she found herself the unwilling poster child of a PR campaign by the hypercorp to increase their reputation in the uplift community. Unfortunately, she was deeply unhappy at her work since she felt like she was seldom permitted to do any real research and spent most of her time at press events. She was also constantly surveiled by an Oversight handler who made sure she didn’t do or say anything that might portray Provolve or the Consortium in a negative light.

During a press junket on Erato, Jane decided she’d had enough and slipped her handler. Unsure of what to do next, she ran into a group of scum from Stars and blurted out her plight. Sympathetic, they sneaked her aboard the swarm. Over the next few weeks, Jane made herself useful by healing a number of small medical complaints aboard Three Sheets to the Wind and rapidly gained reputation. Recently, she was invited aboard The Stars Our Destination itself and given the codes for the medical and research facilities, since there were few others in the flotilla who could make good use of them.","Jane still feels like she has to prove her usefulness to the swarm and does anything she can to help out in a given situation. However, she is ercely protective of her privacy and has a curtained-off area at the back of the Stars medical bay that she has requested no one else go in to.

When the strike was called and the EDF anarchists revealed themselves, Singh threw in with the strikers, locked down the barracks where most of the security personnel were resting, and opened up the armory to the workers.

After the Fall, Singh stuck with the swarm and helped the fleet organize its militia. To this day, he has a hand in securing the fleet’s defenses, working alongside several weapon system collectives and training new militia volunteers. He also consults with conflict-resolution affinity groups that are formed by the scum on an ad-hoc basis to deal with disputes and antisocial crimes. He also secretly coordinates a counter-intelligence operation against outside groups and factions that meddle in the swarm’s affairs.","Singh has a keen sense of what is fair and does his best to mediate any situations aboard the fleet.

She found to her dismay, however, that working for a Ukrainian university meant also working for the oligarchs who pumped money into the institution to use it as a research facility for their own projects.

When the Fall began, those same oligarchs  ed the planet using nanoschematics of her design to modify a number of older launch vehicles on the pad for the capacity to reach Luna—but stranding her and the rest of her team. Lena and her colleagues managed to get another craft off planet, but the engines failed before they could reach a stable orbit and they began falling back towards Earth. A team of HAL strikers and scum swept in and rescued them, earning her eternal gratitude and her considerable skill in patching up busted systems. She immediately turned her skills towards improving and retrofitting the HAL facility. Since the swarm departed Earth, her attention has been focused unceasingly on getting the most out of the Thoughtcrime’s aging manufactories.

Lena’s loyalty is to her friends in the flotilla, and while she personally doesn’t consider herself much of an anarchist or even a real scum, she still considers the swarm her home and the people there her family. She maintains good relationships with the argonauts and often does small favors for them at inner system habitats at which the fleet stops over.","Lena’s personality can be a bit grating since she spends most of her time with machines and her fellow gear-heads and she is prone to snapping orders at whoever is nearby when some- thing needs to be done.

He worked as a combat hacker and network security specialist during the Fall, holding o  TITAN attacks at key farcasting facilities during the evacuation of Earth.
