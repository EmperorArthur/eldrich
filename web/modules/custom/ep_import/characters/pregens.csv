You are a professional gatecrasher, eager to experience new worlds first-hand, despite the dangers—or even because of them. Unlike those who feel that new planets should be protected and preserved, you support colonizing and expanding transhumanity’s presence while maintaining a minimal impact on alien ecosystems. You are also trained in First Contact scenarios and are hopeful of finding new intelligent life—hopefully without sparking some kind of deadly interstellar incident.","COG:15, COO:15, INT:20, REF:15, SAV:15, SOM:20, WIL:10, SPD:1, MOX: 4","Academics: Astrosociology 60, Academics: Astrozoology 55, Academics: Botany 45, Academics: Xenolinguistics 60, Climbing 45, Fray 50, Free Fall 40, Freerunning 60, Hardware: Groundcraft 45, Infiltration 50, Interests: Gatecrashing 60, Interests: Sci-Fi Aliens 45, Investigation 35, Kinesics 30, Kinetic Weapons 45, Language: Native Swedish 85, Language: English 40, Medicine: Paramedic 40, Navigation 60, Networking: Autonomists 55, Networking: Firewall 45, Networking: Scientists 55, Perception 60, Pilot: Groundcraft 45, Pilot: Spacecraft 35, Profession: First Contact 60, Profession: Surveying 45, Profession: Smuggling Tricks 60, Protocol 50, Scrounging 60",Olympian,"COO:5, REF:5, SOM:10, DUR:40","Adrenal Boost, Basic Biomods, Basic Mesh Inserts, Cortical Stack, Direction Sense, Enhanced Vision, Medichines, Oxygen Reserve, Temperature Tolerance",,,"Backup Insurance (Budget):1 month, Breadcrumb Positioning System, Diamond Ax, Electrogravitics Net, Electronic Rope, Knife, Portable Lidar/Radar Sensor System, Radio Booster, Saucer Bot, Shelter Dome, Specimen Container, Spindle with Spindle Climber, Tactical Network Software, Traction Pads, Utilitool ",,Assault Rifle,Smartfabric Vacsuit {Immunogenic System},4150,"@:50,i:20,r:30"

You decry the hedonism and greed of the inner system and the collectivism and anarchy of the autonomists, but you’re more than will- ing to take their pay so that they may kill each other. You follow your own path, however, and when you cease to learn from an experience or increase your own personal capabilities you will move on to the next. You mostly find employment in the inner system, where various social cliques and hypercorps favor ultimates like yourself, knowing they are less likely to be tempted or subverted by rivals.

In an age of mimetic skirmishes, you excel in shaping policy and public opinion. A night- mare combination of marketing agent and political officer, you are adept at media relations, spin control, suppressing dangerous ideas, psychological warfare, ideological purity, and whipping a crowd into a frenzy. Your social manipulation skills work even better face-to-face, where you can run rhetorical circles around opponents and scan body language and microexpressions to spot the slightest hint of untruthfulness or deception.
