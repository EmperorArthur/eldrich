The freeman biomorph offers rulers (some would say tyrants or dictators) a chance to offer citizens a new life without worrying about dissidence. Based on the splicer morph, the freeman is genetically modified to be more obedient, which results in lower Willpower. More insidiously, freeman morphs are genetically modified with a protein that makes their neurons sensitive to light. When combined with an optogenetics module implant (p. 197), these neurons can be activated and deactivated remotely, enabling a monitoring muse or meshed overseer to control the ego's behavior. (The specific behavior affected is chosen with each optogenetics module implant.)

The freeman comes with a specialized monitor AGI installed in a modified ghostrider module. The monitor, usually a modified fork of the tyrant's muse, watches and reports all suspicious actions taken by the primary ego. The purpose of this implant is often concealed. Citizens who sleeve into a freeman morph are told the implant is a security measure that helps prevent infection from TITAN technology or some similar lie. The module is designed to resist tampering and will report to headquarters the instant it detects a hacker's intrusion. The monitor muse can manipulate the ego's behavior or even take control of the morph via its puppet sock, but avoids doing that unless absolutely necessary. Dictators do not want to reveal that their citizens have spies implanted in their skulls, watching them.

Surya,,Biomorphs,"Named for a Hindu sun deity, suryas swim freely in the sun’s corona. Looking roughly like whales or orcas, suryas may reach lengths of ten meters or more. They generate powerful magnetic fields that shield them from solar radiation and heat, while allowing them to surf the solar wind and extract ionized particles. Strong bones and connective tissues protect against the crushing solar gravity. Beneath their thick hides are channels of liquid water interleaved with layers of fat which serve to shield the organism from harmful radiation. Engineered medichines repair tissue damaged by radiation and convert hydrogen ions into water. A surya’s skin is an extraordinary organ, embedded with chromatophores that allow them to transmit alternating patterns of light and dark for communication. In addition, a lateral line runs down their sides, allowing them to detect the long-period sound waves that re ect off the sun’s lower atmosphere and resonate through the corona’s gas and plasma.

Each individual “bug” is capable of crawling, rolling, hopping several meters, or using nanocopter fan blades for airlift. The controlling computer, cortical stack, and sensor systems are distributed throughout the swarm. Though the swarm can “meld” together into a roughly child-sized shape, the swarm is incapable of tackling physical tasks like grabbing, lifting, or holding as a unit.

Theseus,,Biomorphs,"While there are no sanctioned explorations of Earth, a few daring or greedy transhumans defy the laws to salvage there. Some scavengers and explorers still scour the ruins of habitats that were destroyed during the Fall. Others look for wealth and secrets in the quarantined zones on Luna and Mars. Some simply seek out remaining TITAN machines to destroy, wherever they may be found. The theseus is a popular biomorph for this type of work.

Whiplash,,Pods,"Designed by autonomist xenobotanists as an experiment in developing a cyberbrain/planimal interface, whiplash pods are bioengineered from planimal stock found on Sunrise (see Exotic Life, p. 130, Gatecrashing), with other transgenic features (see Whiplash, p. 173, Gatecrashing). Whiplash pods are gaining some traction among gatecrashers due to their ability to blend in to arboreal environments. The primary modi cation made to the whiplash stock was to turn the entire organism upside down and orient the digestive portion of the organism horizontally, so that the whiplash’s tri-lobed orifice faces forward. The whiplash’s grasping roots were also converted into even more motile “walking tentacles” borrowed from other Sunrise planimals. Other adjustments include the addition of a pair of grasping limbs, each with four universally opposable digits; artificial sensing mods (providing transhuman-standard sensing ability); and a general toughening of the internal structure for rigidity and support. The barrel-like body remains very similar to the original planimal stock and, reorientation notwithstanding, the digestive system remains mostly unchanged. The ability to extend and retract the whiplash’s feeding tendril was heavily enhanced, so now the tendril acts more like a two-meter-long chameleon-like tongue than a hanging food-trap.",Expensive,50000,FALSE,GC.151,"COO:5, SOM:10, DUR:40","5,5","COG:30, COO:30, INT:30, REF:30, SAV:30, SOM:30, WIL:30",Walker,,,,"Access Jacks, Basic Biomods, Basic Mesh Inserts, Chameleon Skin, Cortical Stack, Cyberbrain, Mnemonic Augmentation, Puppet Sock","Social Stigma:Pod,Alien Biochemistry",50
