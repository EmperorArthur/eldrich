Mobility Systems,Robotic Enhancements,Mobility,tank-tread,"Shells are designed with a wide range of propulsion systems, and are sometimes built for a specific environment/gravity. Some synthmorphs may have multiple mobility systems. Many such systems are retractable, meaning they can be folded away into the shell’s frame.",FALSE,EP.310

Software Plug-Ins,Personal Augmentations,Plugins,computing,"Plug-ins are simply programs attached to the mind-state emulation software, so that the ego may access them immediately. A plug-in requires a Complex Action to install; once installed, it is “carried” by the infomorph, so that if the infomorph moves to another device, the plug-in moves with it. Plug-ins may be deleted with a Quick Action. Almost any software can be installed as a plug-in, including standard programs, scorchers, and skillsofts (the latter require virtual skillware to run). Other active infomorphs (including AIs and muses) cannot be attached as plug-ins, as they require their own mind-emulation suite. An inactive infomorph, however, could be attached, just like any other electronic data.",FALSE,TH.139
Armor,,Armor,kevlar-vest,"Modern personal armor systems have advanced from the high-modulus polyethylene thermoplastics and aramid fabrics of the early 21st century. Armor in Eclipse Phase is derived from biotech, in the form of organoweave fibers and crystalline-grown plates, and nanotech, in the form of shock-absorbing fullerene (p. 298) materials. Occasionally other materials are used, such as metallic glass plates or shear-resistant fluids that harden against impacts. Such armor protects against (armor-piercing) bullets and kinetic impacts as well as bladed weapons and piercing sharp objects. They also insulate against both the explosive heating of energy weapons and electrical shocks. While such armor protects against bullets, the layers of material catch the bullet and redistribute its kinetic energy across the body, which can still result in severe blunt force trauma.",FALSE,EP.313
Armor Mods,Armor,Mods,kevlar-vest,Armor modifications add extra materials or coatings that either enhance the armor’s resistance to certain dangers or provide other effects. Armor mods may be easily added or removed with the appropriate nanobot applicators.,FALSE,EP.313
Communications,,Comms,talk,"The oldest and most widespread communications technology still in regular use is radio.

The smallest radios are no larger than a speck of dust and have a range of no more than 20 meters, while the largest are the size of a truck and have a range of many thousands of miles. Radios large and small are ubiquitous and almost all devices contain at least short-range radios so they may interact with the mesh. Most morphs are equipped with basic mesh inserts (p. 300) that include an implanted radio. For radio ranges, see p. 299.",FALSE,"EP.313, GC.154"

Substances,,Substances,pill,"In Eclipse Phase, the transhuman desire to enhance the body and mind—especially with chemicals—merges right into humanity’s popular pastime of recreational substance abuse. Drugs of all kinds, whether they be chemical, nano-based, or electronic, are not only popular but widespread. While advances in biotechnology have eliminated many of the side effects that once plagued drug users, transhuman bodies remain complicated environments, and so side effects (especially with long-term use) are still a factor.",FALSE,EP.317
Drugs,Substances,Drugs,pill,"The drugs described here are usually (but not always bene cial), and are typically taken intentionally.

Almost all bio, chemical, and nano drugs can be replicated as narcoalgorithms, with corresponding effect (gamemaster discretion). Standard duration is 3 hours.

Toxins,Substances,Toxins,poison-bottle,"Chemical warfare involves using the toxic properties of biological and chemical substances to kill, injure, or incapacitate an enemy. Note that an antidote can be constructed for most toxins if a sample is acquired and an appropriate Medicine or Academics Test is made. This is considered a Task Action with a timeframe of 1 hour. These toxins only affect biomorphs; synthmorphs are immune.",FALSE,EP.324
Nanotoxins,Substances,Nanotoxins,poison-bottle,,FALSE,EP.324
Pathogens,Substances,Pathogens,biohazard,"A pathogen is an infectious biological agent that causes disease or illness to its host. While natural pathogens rarely strive to kill their hosts, germ warfare programs revived during the Fall—or instigated by the TITANs—sought to modify and use pathogens as a weapon of war. The ideal characteristics of lethal biological agents are high infectivity, high potency, availability of vaccines, and delivery as an aerosol. Most biomorphs are immune to standard pathogens thanks to their basic biomods, and medichines will protect against most others. However, even these defenses may not protect against diseases left by the TITANs or a new terrorist cell’s biowar bug. It is largely recommended that pathogens be handled as a plot device, rather than an active threat to the characters. Pathogens have no effect on synthmorphs.",FALSE,EP.324
Psi Drugs,Substances,Psi,pill,"Research into the Watts-MacLeod strain has resulted in several exceptional breakthroughs involving the creation of psi-impacting drugs.

Nanotechnology,,Nano,materials-science,"Nanotechnology is the precise manipulation of matter at the atomic level, typically using millions of microscale nanomachines. Nanotechnology transformed manufacturing, enabling new techniques and materials. The advent of nanofabrication—building objects from the molecular level up—transformed economies, allowing people to simply manufacture whatever they needed from raw materials. Nanotechnology is still a growing  field, however, and has its limitations.

Advanced Nanotech,Nanotechnology,Advanced,materials-science,"Advanced nanotechnology includes more recent developments. Like basic nanotech, advanced nanotechnology cannot self-replicate but the nanobots can function normally in most environments and are highly resistant to bacterial attacks and other environ- mental problems. Typical advanced nanotech consists of a generator—known as a “hive”—that produces nanobots as long as it is supplied with raw materials. Every such hive also includes a miniature disassembly unit and/or specialized nanomachines that collect raw materials for the generator. These hives produce nanobot swarms that are set loose to perform some function in the world.",FALSE,EP.326

Kinetic Weapons,Weapons,Kinetic,walther-ppk,"Kinetic weapons damage the target by ring a hard impact projectile at high-velocities. Slugthrowers have evolved from the mechanical rearms of the early 21st century, however, and now fall into two categories: chemical rearms and railguns. Though their mechanisms for ring are different, they are roughly similar in effect. Railguns have a higher penetration and inflict more damage, which is offset by more limited ammunition choices. While modern beam weapons have their uses, they rarely match the punch of kinetic weapons, therefore slugthrowers are still perceived as the most versatile and effective weapon system.

Kinetic weapons are constructed from lightweight, reinforced plastoceramic materials, which are easily produced even without nanofabrication. By default, modern kinetic weapons are ambidextrous but more importantly feature safety and smartlink systems (p. 343) that automatically connect to the wielder’s mesh inserts for ring assistance, target recognition, and tactical networking.",FALSE,EP.335
Beam Weapons,Weapons,Beam,ray-gun,"Beam weapons is a broad category for a number of electromagnetic weapons with a wide range of effects. With a few exceptions, energy weapons are primarily used for less-than-lethal purposes, designed to impair the target rather than kill it.

Servo-hydraulic joints allow the exoskeleton to be maneuvered by mimicking the wearer’s own movements, as well as enhancing their strength. Exoskeletons may also be piloted electronically.
