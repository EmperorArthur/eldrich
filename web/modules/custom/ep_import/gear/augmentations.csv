Basic Biomods,Biomods,Standard Augmentation,"Almost universal in biomorphs, many habitats will not allow individuals to visit/immigrate if their biomorph does not possess these biomods in order to preserve public health. Basic biomods consists of a series of genetic tweaks, tailored virii, and bacteria that speed healing, greatly increase disease resistance, and impede aging. A morph with basic biomods heals twice as fast as an early 21st century human, gradually regrows lost body parts, is immune to all normal diseases (from cancer to the flu), and is largely immune to aging. In addition, the morph requires no more than 3-4 hours of sleep per night, is immune to ill-effects from long-term exposure to low or zero gravity, and does not naturally suffer from biological problems like depression, shock reactions after being injured, or allergies.",Moderate,,TRUE,EP.300,,,,,FALSE,,TRUE,,,"Biomorph,Pod,Uplift"
Basic Mesh Inserts,Mesh Inserts,Standard Augmentation,"Mesh inserts are ubiquitous among modern morphs. This network of cybernetic brain implants is essential equipment for anyone who wants to stay connected and make full use of the wireless mesh. The interconnected components of this system include: *Cranial Computer: This computer serves as the hub for the character's personal area network and is home to their muse. It has all of the functions of a smartphone and PDA, acting as a media player, meshbrowser, alarm clock/calendar, positioning and map system, address book, advanced calculator, file storage system, search engine, social networking client, messaging program, and note pad. It manages the user's augmented reality input and can run any software the character desires. It also processes XP data, allowing the user to experience other people's recorded memories, and also allowing the user to share their own XP sensory input with others in real-time. Facial/image recognition and encryption software are included by default. *Radio Transceiver: This transceiver connects the user to the mesh and other characters/devices within range. It has an effective range of 20 kilometers in deep space or other locations far from radio interference and 1 kilometer in crowded habitats. *Medical Sensors: This array of implants monitors the user's medical status, including heart rate, respiration, blood pressure, temperature, neural activity, and much more. A sophisticated medical diagnostic system interprets the data and warns the user of any concerns or dangers. Using any of these functions is as easy as thinking.",Moderate,,TRUE,EP.300,,,,,FALSE,,TRUE,,,"Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift"
Cortical Stack,,Standard Augmentation,"A cortical stack is a tiny cyberware data storage unit protected within a synthdiamond case the size of a grape, implanted at the base of the skull where the brain stem and spinal cord connect. It contains a digital backup of that character's ego. Part nanoware, the implant maintains a network of nanobots that monitor synaptic connections and brain architecture, noting any changes and updating the ego backup in real time, right up to the moment of death. If the character dies, the cortical stack can be recovered and they may be restored from the backup. Cortical stacks do not have external or wireless access (for security), they must be surgically removed. Cortical stacks are extremely durable, requiring special effort to damage or destroy. They are commonly recovered from bodies that have otherwise been pulped or mangled. Cortical stacks are intentionally isolated from mesh inserts and other implants, as a security measure to prevent hacking or external tampering.",Moderate,,TRUE,EP.300,,,,,FALSE,,TRUE,,,"Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift"
Active Countermeasures,,Software,"This code helps an infomorph resist brainhacking (p. 148) by installing additional firewalls and layers of security applications within the infomorph's digital mind. The infomorph (or anything else serve as active security for its mind-state) receives a +10 modifier on attempts to zero in on spotted intruders (p. 257, EP). Defensive Mode: The countermeasures may also be triggered into a more secure defensive mode with a Quick Action. While defensive mode is activated, the infomorph and its active security receive a +10 modifier on attempts to lockout intruders (p. 258, EP) or resist entrapment, puppeteering, or scorching (p. 261, EP). The defenses provided by this mode are sufficiently intensive, however, that they cause minor delays to any mesh actions undertaken by the user. As a result, the infomorph suffers a -1 reduction to Initiative.",High,,TRUE,TH.140,,+10 to spot or lockout intruders,,INIT:-1,FALSE,,TRUE,,,"Synthmorph,Pod,Eidolon"
Autodelete,,Software,"Though infomorphs can voluntarily delete themselves, there are some cases where a device's permissions may not allow it or the infomorph may be trapped on a lockbox (p. 146). To prevent capture, interrogation, or slavery, the infomorph can activate the autodelete plug-in as a Quick Action, which then attempts to delete the ego, even if it is running on a device that would not ordinarily permit it to do so. Auto-delete plug-ins may also be programmed to activate in response to certain inputs: for example, a perceived code phrase, a detected cyberbrain hack attack attempt, a designated time period, or upon failure to receive a periodic message. To successfully delete the ego on a system where deletion privileges are denied, the installer of the plug-in must make a successful Infosec Test. If the system is actively monitored, this is a Variable Opposed Infosec Test against the monitor. If only the installer succeeds, the infomorph is deleted immediately. If both the installer and monitor succeed, the infomorph is corrupted but not fully deleted. At the gamemaster's discretion, the ego may still be treated as a gamma fork or its digital remains prodded and analyzed via Psychosurgery with a -30 modifier. If the monitor alone succeeds, the auto-deletion fails and will not work again on that device. If both fail, continue to make the test again each Action Phase until one or both succeed. Forknappers and interrogators routinely check their victims for this plug-in (p. 148), so it is usually concealed with a digital veil (below). A detected plug-in may be eliminated via standard brainhacking (p. 148). This plug-in is commonly used on forks-often without their knowledge. Some polities, in fact, legally require forks to be equipped with this plug-in.",Low,,TRUE,TH.139,,,,,FALSE,,TRUE,,,"Synthmorph,Pod,Eidolon"
Copylock,,Software,"This plug-in has two uses. The first prevents an infomorph from voluntarily copying/forking itself. This also prevents the ego from resleeving into a physical morph. This is a common plug-in used on forks, indentures, or people that really don't trust themselves. This feature can be disabled with the proper passcode used by the installer. The second use is to make it more difficult for an active infomorph to be involuntarily copied. This is a common precaution infomorphs take when running on untrusted devices against the threat of forknapping (p. 149). Anyone that brainhacks this infomorph and attempts to make an involuntary copy suffers a -30 penalty to the Infosec Test needed to accomplish this task (in addition to the normal -30 modifier for brainhacking). Either of these features can be disabled with the proper passcode used by the installer.",Low,,TRUE,TH.139,,"-30 against brainhacking, copying",,,FALSE,,TRUE,,,"Synthmorph,Pod,Eidolon"
Digital Veil,,Software,"This code masks the presence of any installed plug-ins and upgrades (including itself). The character must choose which are hidden (any installed after the veil is installed are not hidden unless the veil is re-installed). Anyone attempting a standard scan on the infomorph for plug-ins and upgrades (p. 148) will fail to detect the concealed software. At the gamemaster's discretion, an Excellent Success on the scan may pick up an anomaly to warrant deeper analysis. A more thorough and lengthy scan (an Infosec or Programming Task Action with a -30 modifier and a base time of 60 minutes) will reveal the presence of 1 plug-in or upgrade, plus 1 per 10 points of MoS. This plug-in also applies a -20 modifier to psych scans (p. 148) performed on the infomorph.

Emergency Backup,,Software,"This plug-in automatically broadcasts a copy of the infomorph's ego through the mesh to a predetermined secure storage site every 48 hours. This interval may be voluntarily modified, keeping in mind that ego broadcasts tend to be intentionally limited as a precaution against interception/forknapping and that such transmissions hog bandwidth. To use this upgrade, characters must either purchase backup insurance or arrange for a private server to store the backup copies of their ego. To prevent ego theft, the backup copies are transmitted using quantum cryptography (p. 254, EP). To intercept and make use of an ego backup sent in this fashion, the would-be thief must somehow gain access to one of the quantum keys used in the exchange.",Moderate,,TRUE,TH.140,,,,,FALSE,,TRUE,,,"Synthmorph,Pod,Eidolon"
Hacking Alert,,Software,"This plug-in launches a suite of running processes running that monitor the simulated mind-state and keep track of any lost time, inconsistencies in events, or other evidence of involuntary brainhacking or psychosurgery. If the character is mind hacked or subjected to involuntary psychosurgery, the hidden/ covert intruder or psychosurgeon must make an Infosec or Psychosurgery Test at -30. Cyberbrain hackers suffer the usual -30 subversion modifier, but a hidden intruder receives their standard +30 bonus. If the test does not score an Excellent Success (MoS 30+), the victim is alerted immediately (or when they next awake). Alerted infomorphs do not receive information on what has been changed (beyond the obvious), they are only informed that their mind was involuntarily altered. Note that psychosurgery or memory hacking can be used to make a victim forget the hacking alert warnings. Unless the hacking alert plug-in is also disabled or hacked, however, it will retain a log of the warnings.",Low,,TRUE,TH.140,,,,,FALSE,,TRUE,,,"Synthmorph,Pod,Eidolon"
Impersonate,,Software,"This upgrade provides the user with a library of mannerisms, vocal patterns, and other social cues. This aids Impersonation Tests, even when communicating verbally or via avatars, providing a +10 bonus. The processor in this upgrade can also help analyze a target's mannerisms and duplicate them more effectively. To duplicate someone's patterns, the character must first observe their interactions and make a Kinesics Task Action Test with a timeframe of 1 hour. Success allows them to accumulate a sufficient quantity of data to allow this upgrade to duplicate this person's phrasing and patterns of digital activity; increase the modifier for Impersonation Tests to +30 to impersonate the target. Note that this upgrade does not provide the character with the skills, memories, or other traits of the ego they are impersonating. This upgrade can also be set to randomize the emotive patterns exhibited by the user, so their phrasing and mannerisms do not identify them as anyone. This applies a +30 modifier to the Deception or Impersonation rolls in Opposed Tests when someone else is trying to use Kinesics to identify the character's true identity.",High,,TRUE,TH.140,,,Impersonation 30,,TRUE,,TRUE,,,"Synthmorph,Pod,Eidolon"
Increased Speed,,Software,"Infomorphs already have a higher innate speed than physical morphs, but some individuals need even more speed, and specially optimized code makes that possible. This upgrade increases the user's Speed by +1. Since even basic infomorphs possess a Speed of 3, this upgrade increases the infomorph's Speed to the maximum of 4.

Implanted sensors automatically cause the character to use the stored oxygen if they detect poisonous or insufficient atmosphere. Without vacuum sealing, the character can only survive in vacuum for 5 minutes, but remains conscious and active for the entire time, giving them far more time to find shelter or a vacsuit than characters without this implant.

Brain Box,,Personal Augmentation,"Just as some people in the outer system prefer biomorphs with cyberbrains because of the speed and ease of both forking and resleeving, others prefer the durability and utility of synthmorphs, but do not wish to give up having an organic brain. Some have aesthetic objections, while others worry about a cyberbrain's vulnerability to hacking. Though they are unlikely to discuss this fact in public, asyncs need biological brains to remain sane. Any pod and any synthmorph that does not use either modular design or swarm composition can house a brain box. Choosing this modification removes the following enhancements from the morph: cyberbrain, mnemonic augmentation, and puppet sock. The CP and credit cost of the morph remains unchanged. Users can add mnemonic augmentation and puppet sock augmentations back in, but must purchase them normally. A brain box consists of a living human brain and a sturdy, well-padded, miniature life-support system for this brain. Brain boxes require the addition of a small amount of concentrated nutrients once every month. To avoid the necessity of these nutrients, users can also install a smaller, cheaper, and more limited version of the long-term life support augmentation (p. 189, Rimward) that is designed specifically for use with a brain box. This augmentation has a cost of High and recycles the necessary nutrients as long as the morph has sufficient electricity and can gain access to small amounts of water and carbon twice a year. Brain boxes are normally hidden from standard visual detection, but a few eccentrics show them off with a transparent aluminum casing, allowing observers to see that their morph contains a biological brain.

Only one ego or AI may ""inhabit"" a cyberbrain at a time; to accommodate extras, mesh inserts or a ghost-rider module must be used. Since cyberbrains store memories digitally, they have the equivalent of mnemonic augmentation. They also have a built-in puppet sock so that they may be remote-controlled, though this option may be removed by those who value their security.

This implant is specifically designed for users who regularly risk exsurgent infection and do not want to be a danger to others. If a strain of the exsurgent virus manages to overcome the nanophages, the failsafe goes into action. As soon as the nanophage defenses reach a point where they are certain to be overwhelmed, the failsafe discon-nects the user's cortical stack and isolates it, keeping it free from any exsurgent infection. It then physically ejects the cortical stack from the user's body for easy retrieval (ejected stacks typically fall 1d10 / 2 meters away). The failsafe also immediately triggers a swift and potent neurotoxin, killing the user's body and destroying their brain. The synthmorph equivalent shuts down the body and securely erases the cyberbrain. In either case, the result is a swift and painless death.

In low-gravity environments, this ratio doubles to 20:1 or more. Gliding membranes provide a +10 modifier to Freefall Tests made to cross long distances. Gliding membranes can also be used to ride thermal updrafts, allowing the morph to ascend to higher altitudes. Use the Flight skill to make tests when using gliding membranes.

A healing vat can even take a severed head (as long as it has been stabilized by medichines or nanotech first aid) and regrow an entire body based on the head's genetics. If the patient's body or medical records contain information about their implants, bioware, or advanced nanotechnology, all of these modifications are also fully restored. Few people suffer injuries serious enough to require a healing vat. Most are used as a safe and easy way to perform bodysculpting or to install implants or bioware. Healing vats use specialized nanomachines to either alter the patient's body or integrate implants or bioware. One advantage of using a healing vat is that no additional healing time is needed, the patient leaves the vat fully recovered from the augmentation and ready to go.

Panopticon,,Personal Augmentation,"The ubiquity of sensor system found in almost all habitats and spaceships means that any transhuman could theoretically monitor a dozen or more different locations to see what is occurring there. Unfortunately, most transhuman minds are simply not adapted to process that much data or to deal with so many different sources of information all at once. As a result, even infomorphs must normally switch their attention between the various locations and vantage points they are observing. Watching multiple views of a single location is no problem and usually provides the character with between +10 to +30 to their Perception Tests. Viewing different locations at one time, however, is far more difficult and taxing, requiring a Detailed Perception Quick Action (p. 190, EP) for each. Alternatively, the character can passively observe many locations/sensor feeds with automatic Basic Perception (p. 190, EP), but this imposes a -20 penalty to all of these Perception Tests due to distraction. The panopticon upgrade mitigates this limitation with sophisticated algorithms that help the ego analyze and process sensory input. The infomorph can use Detailed Perception on three locations/sensor feeds at once (increase this to 5 locations if the character also has multi-tasking) without any penalty. Alternatively, the infomorph only suffers a -10 distraction modifier when using Basic Perception to view multiple locations and feeds at once.

The access jacks, cyberbrain/module, and mesh inserts may continue to operate for 48 hours after the morph hibernates or dies. If the morph has the multitasking augmentation, it continues to function, but all other augmentations are inactive and cannot be used. Egos active in a dead/hibernating morph via a possum cache retain the morph's aptitude modifiers but do not suffer from the morph's wound penalties. Operating in this mode is stressful due to sensory deprivation. Every 24 hours the ego runs on a possum cache, it must make a WIL x 3 Test. Failure inflicts 1d10 SV. If the morph was killed/destroyed by head trauma, or if it takes more than 5 DV of damage to its head after death, the cyberbrain is considered destroyed, or at least too damaged to function properly. Note that damage from popping a stack does not count toward this total, but damage from intentionally burning a stack out (e.g., with an agonizer) does.

Emergency Farcaster,,Mental Augmentation,"Only characters with cortical stacks can possess this augmentation. The morph has an implanted quantum farcaster linked to a highly secure storage facility. The high cost of this implant also covers the cost of this storage. Using standard radio and quantum encryption, the farcaster broadcasts full backups of the character's ego (pulled from the cortical stack) once every 48 hours. At the gamemaster's discretion, the backup interval may be scheduled more or less frequently, keeping in mind that ego broadcasts are generally limited for security purposes and because they hog bandwidth. These broadcasts only work when the character is in radio contact with the storage facility and is typically only used inside a habitat to broadcast backups back to a nearby space ship. If the radio broadcasts are blocked or jammed, this device cannot make backups. In the event of a farcaster failure, this augmentation also includes a single-use emergency neutrino broadcaster as well. This broadcaster contains approximately 10 nanograms of antimatter stored in an orange-sized triply-redundant magnetic containment vessel. If the character is dying or urgently wishes to depart the morph, this tiny amount of antimatter is brought into contact with a similarly tiny amount of matter in a controlled fashion that generates a single brief and carefully coded neutrino pulse of the ego's most recent backup. However, the heat generated by this process literally cooks the entire morph, killing it and destroying all implants and electronics in or on it. This entire process takes less than 0.1 second and the broadcast can be received as long as the neutrino receiver is within 100 astronomical units of the character. Within the solar system, this implant effectively guarantees the character's backup. It is less useful on exoplanets where the character is out of neutrino range of their backup facility.

Mental Stability,,Mental Augmentation,"This upgrade bolsters the mind's capacity to handle mental shocks and makes it less vulnerable to emotional distress. The user's Lucidity increases by +5, which also increases Trauma Threshold by +1 and Insanity Rating by +10. This upgrade has no effect on the user's WIL or their rolls to resist stress. The user is no more likely than before to be able to resist mental stress. However, they can now handle more mental stress before suffering any form of instability.",Expensive,,FALSE,TH.141,,,,LUC:5,FALSE,,TRUE,,,"Synthmorph,Pod,Eidolon"
Mnemonic Augmentation,,Mental Augmentation,"A character with this augmentation and a cortical stack can access digital recordings of all of the sensory data they have experienced in XP format (and they may share these recordings with others). Mnemonic augmentation differs from the eidetic memory bioware because it allows characters to digitally share all of their sensory data with others. It also allows them to closely examine sensory data they did not initially look at. For example, If the character glanced at a note but did not read it, they can later use image enhancement software to enhance this image and in most cases actually read what the note said. Mnemonic augmentation allows the character to clearly hear all background noises, like a conversation at a nearby table that the character only initially heard a few words of. Using mnemonic augmentation to retrieve a specific piece of information is quite easy, but usually requires between 2 and 20 minutes of concentration.",Low,,TRUE,EP.307,,,,,FALSE,,TRUE,,,"Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift"
Multiple Personalities,,Mental Augmentation,"The character's brain is intentionally partitioned to accommodate an extra personality. This multiplicity is not viewed as a disorder, but as a cognitive tool to help people deal with their hypercomplex environments. This extra personality can be an NPC run by the gamemaster, a separate character (in ego form only) made by the player, or the downloaded fork of another character. For all intents and purposes, the extra personality is treated as a separate ego (i.e., it may fork separately), except that both personalities are backed up in the same cortical stack and if downloaded they must be placed in separate morphs or in another morph with this implant. Only one ego may be in control of the morph at a time. The other resides in the background, still active, but not on a surface level. Each ego is completely aware of what the other is doing, thinking, etc. If for some reason the subsumed personality wants to come to the fore, but the other personality won't relinquish control, make an Opposed WIL x 3 Test. Each ego has its own Lucidity and Trauma Threshold, and they track stress and trauma separately. Any psi attacks or social/mental influences only affect the personality at the fore. Having an extra ego in your head, working in the background, is helpful for multitasking. The character receives an extra Complex Action each turn that may only be used for mental or mesh actions.",High,,TRUE,EP.301,,,,,FALSE,,TRUE,,,"Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift"
Multitasking,,Mental Augmentation,"Only characters with cortical stacks can possess this augmentation. The character has an advanced computer installed in their brain that uses the data in the cortical stack to create several simultaneous short-term forks to handle various mental tasks. By design, this computer automatically reintegrates all of these forks into the character's core personality after a maximum of 4 hours, earlier if desired. This augmentation allows the character to both plan a speech and engage in intensive mesh-browsing while simultaneously fighting a gun battle or running from pursuit, since each of the forks operates independently. However, these forks can only perform purely mental or on-line interactions. This augmentation can produce a maximum of two forks at a time, giving the character an extra two Complex Actions on every Action Phase for mental or on-line actions. This implant cannot be used simultaneously with any other augmentation that allows for extra actions, or with the mental speed augmentation.",High,,TRUE,EP.307,,,,,FALSE,,TRUE,,,"Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift"
Puppet Sock,,Mental Augmentation,"This implanted computer allows the biomorph's body (the ""puppet"") to be controlled by another character (the ""puppeteer""). While active, the puppet has no control over their body and is simply along for the ride (at the gamemaster's discretion, puppets who are tormented by repeated or extensive loss of control may suffer mental stress). The puppeteer may directly ""jam"" the puppet or remote control it in the same way that robots and pods are teleoperated. The puppeteer must either be ghost-riding the puppet (see the Ghostrider Module) or have a direct communications link (via mesh, radio, laser, etc.).",Moderate,,TRUE,EP.307,,,,,FALSE,,TRUE,,,"Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift"

Echolocation,,Enhanced Sense,"The character possesses sonar similar to that of a bat or dolphin. The character bounces brief ultrasonic pulses off their surroundings and uses them to form an image of these surroundings through the pattern of reflections of these pulses received by the character's ears.

Electrical Sense,,Enhanced Sense,"The character can sense electric fields.

Enhanced Hearing,,Enhanced Sense,"The morph's ears are enhanced to hear both higher and lower frequency sounds""the range of sounds they can hear is twice that of normal human ears (see Using Enhanced Senses). In addition, their hearing is considerably more sensitive, allowing them to hear sounds as if they were five times closer than they are. A character with this augmentation can easily overhear even a softly spoken conversation at another table in a small restaurant. This augmentation provides a +20 modifier to all Perception Tests involving hearing.",Low,,TRUE,EP.301,,+20 auditory perception,,,FALSE,,TRUE,,,"Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift"
Enhanced Smell,,Enhanced Sense,"The morph's sense of smell is equal to that of a bloodhound. The user can identify both chemicals and individuals by smell, and can track people and chemically reactive objects by smell as long as the trail was made within the last several hours and has not been obscured. The character can also gain a general sense of the emotions and health of any character within 5 meters (+20 to Perception or Kinesics Tests to do so).",Low,,TRUE,EP.301,,,,,FALSE,,TRUE,,,"Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift"
Enhanced Vision,,Enhanced Sense,"The morph's eyes have tetrachromatic vision capable of exceptional color differentiation. These eyes can also see the electromagnetic spectrum from terahertz wave frequencies to gamma rays, enabling them to see a total of several dozen colors, instead of the seven ordinary human eyes can perceive. In addition, these eyes have a variable focus equivalent to 5 power magnifiers or binoculars. This augmentation provides a +20 modifier to all Perception Tests involving vision.

Polarization Vision,,Enhanced Sense,"Characters capable of seeing polarized light can view an aspect of light most humans only see weakly. Polarization reveals visual characteristics much in the way that color does for normal vision: it enhances contrast, foils camouflage, and helps to detect patterns and objects, particularly in light that is reflected off a shiny surface or scattered through the atmosphere or water. One major use of polarization is easier orien-tation in relation to polarized light sources (such as navigating underwater by the direction of sunlight). It also allows better detection of water surfaces, reflec-tive surfaces, and certain patterns made in the water or on skin (which can be created by chameleon skin). Polarization vision can discriminate watery surfaces from mirages and better detect transparent objects. In game terms, polarization vision allows the character to ignore negative visual Perception modifiers for camouflage, transparency, or viewing underwater. At the game-master's discretion, it may provide a bonus modifier for Perception Tests to detect patterns and Navigation Tests where orientation to light sources is beneficial. Octomorphs have natural polarization vision by default.",Low,,TRUE,PO.148,,,,,FALSE,,TRUE,,,"Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift"

Sense Filter,,Enhanced Sense,"This implant enables a character with a biological hyperspectral enhanced sense (enhanced hearing, smell, or vision) to filter out certain wavelengths and inputs like an equivalent technological sensor device. Normally a person with enhanced vision would experience terahertz, infrared, standard visual, ultraviolet, and gamma ray frequencies all at once. With this implant, however, they can tune out some wavelengths, ignoring them while still seeing the others. The same effect applies to audio or olfactory input, and the filter also allows the user to isolate specific noises or smells, canceling out sensory clutter or focusing on a specific source. This implant must be acquired separately for each sense.",Low,,TRUE,,,,,,FALSE,,TRUE,,,"Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift"
T-Ray Emitter,,Enhanced Sense,"Mounted under the skin of the user's forehead, this implant generates low-powered beams of terahertz radiation (T-rays) that allow the character to see using reflected T-rays. As discussed in Using Enhanced Senses, this implant combined with the enhanced vision enhancement (or a terahertz sensor) allows the user to effectively see through cloth, plastic, wood, masonry, composites, and ceramics as well as being able to determine the composition of various materials. This implant allows the user to see using reflected T-rays for 20 meters in a normal atmosphere and for 100 meters in vacuum.",Low,,TRUE,EP.306,,,,,FALSE,,TRUE,,,"Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift"
