Deception Scanner,Sensors,,,,,,TRUE,Low,,"This device is used to scan a subject's brain activity for patterns indicating deception. There are two versions, digital and analog. The digital scanner model plugs into the access jacks of a pod or synthmorph or establishes a wireless connection with the morph's basic mesh inserts. With analog scanners, a band is placed around the subject's head to measure brain activity with fMRI. The analog version only works on morphs with biological brains (meaning it doesn't work on pods or cyberbrained biomorphs but does work on biocore morphs). The subject's responses to questioning are matched against a database of patterns known to indicate deception. In game terms, the scanner makes an Opposed Test, pitting its Perception 60 against the target's Deception skill; success indicates it detects falsehoods. Deception scanners can be used to monitor a subject's response patterns over time to increase their likelihood of spotting lies. For each hour a scanner is used on the same subject, apply a cumulative +10 modifier to its Perception Test, up to a maximum of +30. Note that subjects who are emotionally distressed, suffer from mental disorders, or have undergone physical exertion are harder to read; gamemasters should apply a -10 to -30 to the Perception Test as they feel appropriate. Subjects with edited memories may be unaware they are telling falsehoods and will not fail the test. In many jurisdictions, failure on a deception scanner is not enough to gain a conviction and can't be used in court, as they are known to be only partially reliable and sometimes return false positives. It is, however, used as a legal justification for engaging in psychosurgery to explore the subject's memories. Digital detection scanners have no effect against targets with truth filter cyberware.

Quick scans take only 30 seconds, but are less accurate (50% detection rate). Thorough scans take 1 hour, but have a higher detection rate (80%). See Exsurgent Virus Detection (below), for details on handling scans. If the verifier detects an exsurgent infection, it immediately disables its wireless capability, flashes a visible physical (not AR) warning (the entire device flashes a bright neon red color three times), and self- destructs so as to prevent it from being infected and used as an infection vector.",,

While such gear is cheap and easily nanofabricated, it is clumsier, slower, more difficult to use, more prone to malfunc- tion, relies on physical media, and is generally a pain in the ass to work with.

Disassemblers,Nanotechnology,,,,,,TRUE,High,,"Also known as smart corrosives, these nanobots break down any matter. Their advantage over common acids is that not only are they able to break down any material by using energy to disrupt chemical bonds, but that they can be programmed to take apart certain components while ignoring others, leaving them intact. Disassemblers are a common weapon used against synthmorphs, eating away their components without having to worry about accidentally splashing biomorphs. Upon contact, these nanobots inflict 1d10 / 2 damage (round up) per Action Turn. Accumulated damage counts as a wound when the Wound Threshold is reached. Both Energy and Kinetic armor protect against this damage, but these armors are eaten away as well, so the Armor Value is reduced by the soaked DV.",EP,329
Healing Vat,Nanotechnology,,,,,,TRUE,High,,"Healing vats were the first type of nanotech medicine developed and remain the most powerful medical devices in common use. With the exception of a few exceptionally deadly nanoplagues, a healing vat can cure any disease and heal any injury. As long as the patient is alive when they are place in the healing vat, they will not only survive, but emerge without a scratch. A healing vat can even take a severed head (as long as it has been stabilized by medichines or nanotech first aid) and regrow an entire body based on the head's genetics. If the patient's body or medical records contain information about their implants, bioware, or advanced nanotechnology, all of these modifications are also fully restored. Few people suffer injuries serious enough to require a healing vat. Most are used as a safe and easy way to perform bodysculpting or to install implants or bioware. Healing vats use specialized nanomachines to either alter the patient's body or integrate implants or bioware. One advantage of using a healing vat is that no additional healing time is needed, the patient leaves the vat fully recovered from the augmentation and ready to go. Every hospital, clinic, bodyshop, and augmentation parlor has several healing vats. The time required by a healing vat varies with the severity of the damage it is healing or the extent of the modification being made, as noted on the Healing Vat table.",EP,326

Suborning Swarm,Nanotechnology,,,,,,TRUE,High,,"This nanotechnology is highly restricted in most of the solar system, including on all worlds and habitats controlled by the Planetary Consortium. The nanobots in this swarm are programmed to identify all sensors and devices that transmit any signal in the electromagnetic spectrum. This includes radios, ectos, communication links, microbugs, x-ray emitters, etc. Once identified, the swarm's operator can order the nanobots to suborn these sensors and transmitters. Nanomachines in the swarm then attach themselves to all of these devices in the area and can attempt to either disable or tap into them. Disabling sensors and transmitters is rather easy; the swarm simply creates enough electromagnetic interference in and around the device to make it unusable. Make a Simple Test using the swarm's Hardware: Electronics skill of 40. Success indicates all devices have been temporarily disabled. Failure means that a small portion of devices remain active or semi-functional. Large devices may not be disabled. Each swarm can disable sensors and transmitters for up to 1 hour before it must be recharged. Temporary disablement has no long-term damaging effects on the devices. Operators of the devices may attempt to overrride the jamming; in this case the operator must succeed in an Variable Opposed Interfacing Test against the swarm's skill of 40, per the rules for Radio Jamming, p. 262, EP. Tapping into devices is more difficult. In this case, make a regular test using the swarm's Hardware: Electronics skill of 40. It is recommended the game- master apply a single roll to determine the swarm's general effectiveness, and handle individual devices on a case-by-case basis as needed. If successful, the swarm siphons sensor and communication feeds through physical taps in the devices' internal electronics. Note that encrypted transmissions are not decoded, though the operator (or their muse) can attempt to decrypt them on an individual basis. Suborning swarms are ineffective against other nanoswarms (including smart dust) and the sensory and communication implants and enhancements of biomorphs. They are, however, effective against the sensors and communications of robots and synthmorphs, and are especially dangerous to swarmanoids (including skulkers and smart swarms), as they inhibit the ability of the swarmanoid components to communicate. If the Hardware: Electronics Test to disable is successful against a swarmanoid, that morph suffers a negative modifier equal to the suborning swarm's MoS for as long as it remains in the swarm's area of effect.",,

Stealthed Landing Pod,Espionage,,,,,,FALSE,Expensive,,"Sometimes, Firewall teams cannot egocast to a location and must instead physically travel there. If this location is sufficiently dangerous or simply does not welcome visitors, docking a spacecraft may not be possible. In these cases, Firewall teams often use this vehicle. It is designed to be launched from a spacecraft that is passing within 100,000 kilometers of the target. That spacecraft fakes a micrometeor strike or other problem that causes a small explosion and some minor debris. On rare occasions, to insure complete surprise, the spacecraft may actually self-destruct. During this explosion, the landing pod fires a brief burst of its metallic hydrogen rocket to direct it towards its desti- nation, then powers down. The landing pod is heavily stealthed against visual and radar detection, so that it is almost impossible to detect with any sensors if it is not broadcasting or firing its engines (-60 to tests to detect). The landing pod travels toward its destination for between 10 and 100 hours, then approximately 1 minute before it arrives, it fires its engines in a second brief, powerful burst that slows it down to allow it to safely land on its destination. When it fires its engines, sensors on its destination are likely to detect it (+30), but residents of this habitat will hopefully not have time to respond before the operatives can enter the habitat. Landings are often coordinated with mesh intrusions that seek to distract the target's defenses or temporarily disable the local sensors. The landing pod can carry up to six human-sized morphs and has long-term life support facilities to allow it to transport biomorphs. The landing pod has sufficient fuel to allow it to also take off from a habitat and rendezvous with a nearby spacecraft. It also contains a compact radio, microwave, and laser farcaster that allow operatives to remain in secure contact with others and to egocast off the habitat, as long as the users can remain in radio contact with the landing pod. The most expensive landing pods contain a single-use neutrino farcaster capable of broadcasting backups of up to six egos. Using this farcaster destroys the landing pod.

Each nanobot contains tiny cameras, microphones, a tiny computer, a radio, and chemical sensors, as well as short legs that allow them to walk and climb at a rate of 5 cm per second. When a character dumps a packet of smart dust in a room, it will cover every surface in the room within 20 minutes, including all furniture and the insides of every drawer and other space that is not airtight. At this point, the smart dust has recorded all data about the room that can be obtained by exceedingly detailed observation, including the DNA of everyone who has visited the room in the last week or two. The smart dust can then either broadcast a brief, highly compressed signal, or it can send all of its information to a few hundred nanobots that then walk to a pre-arranged destination for pickup and downloading by their user. The user need only find a single nanobot with a nanodetector to acquire the information obtained by the smart dust.
