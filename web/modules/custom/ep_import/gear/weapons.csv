The bolter's beam is invisible.

Laser Pulser,Pulser,Beam Weapons,"Laser weapons use focused beams of light to inflict damage on the target by burning into it and causing it's outer surface to vaporize and expand, creating an explosive effect. The laser beam is pulsed in order to bite into the target before the beam is diffused. Pulsers are vulnerable to atmospheric effects like dust, mist, smoke, or rain, however—the gamemaster should reduce their effective range categories as appropriate. Note that laser pulses are invisible in the normal visual spectrum (but are visible to characters with enhanced vision). Pulsers are medium-sized and fire in semi-auto mode. One advantage to the pulser is that it can be placed in less-lethal mode. In this case, it first fires a pulse at the target to create a ball of plasma, quickly fired by a second pulse that strikes the plasma and creates a flash-bang shockwave to stun and disorient the target. This blast has an area of effect with a 1-meter radius. Anyone caught in the blast must make a SOM x 2 Test (SOM x 3 for synthmorphs or biomorphs with any form of pain tolerance). Failure means the target is temporarily stunned and disoriented and loses their next action. A critical failure means the target is knocked down and paralyzed for 1 Action Turn per 10 points of MoF.

Antimatter Grenade,,Explosives,"Sometimes, Firewall operatives are faced with a situation where defeating an exsurgent threat is impossible and total destruction of the incursion is the only effective option. Antimatter grenades are ideal tools for this task. This weapon comes in two versions, large and small. The large grenade contains 0.1 grams of antimatter, which is sufficient to create a 5-kiloton blast. In its standard setting, the explosion destroys everything within 1 kilometer of the device, and causes severe damage for up to 2 kilometers. This device will completely destroy any habitat up to 5 kilometers across. The small grenade contains 0.0002 grams of antimatter, which is sufficient to create a blast equivalent to 10 tons of TNT. In its standard setting, the explosion destroys everything within 150 meters of the device and severe damage for up to 300 meters. Both weapons can blast a hole through the hull of any habitat and will destroy any spacecraft they are detonated on. Antimatter grenades are highly illegal almost everywhere and possession of one is grounds for severe punishment in most of the solar system. Both weapons can also be set to generate a brief but intense magnetic field a fraction of a second before the blast, which somewhat directs the explosion. Used in this manner, the large device has a blast radius that only extends 400 meters in the protected direction, and the small device has a blast radius that only extends 60 meters in the protected direction. The large antimatter grenade has a mass of 3 kilograms and is a rounded box roughly 10 centimeters on a side; the small antimatter grenade has a mass of 0.5 kilograms and is a box roughly 5 centimeters on a side. Both of these devices can only be detonated using a mini-sized detonator containing a tiny qubit reservoir that contains a QE comm, which transmits to the tiny qubit reservoir in the device. The device can be detonated immediately or set to go off at a predetermined time. The user can also deactivate the device at any time before it explodes.
