Laser Pulser,Pulser,Beam Weapons,"Laser weapons use focused beams of light to inflict damage on the target by burning into it and causing it's outer surface to vaporize and expand, creating an explosive effect. The laser beam is pulsed in order to bite into the target before the beam is diffused. Pulsers are vulnerable to atmospheric effects like dust, mist, smoke, or rain, however—the gamemaster should reduce their effective range categories as appropriate. Note that laser pulses are invisible in the normal visual spectrum (but are visible to characters with enhanced vision). Pulsers are medium-sized and fire in semi-auto mode. One advantage to the pulser is that it can be placed in less-lethal mode. In this case, it first fires a pulse at the target to create a ball of plasma, quickly fired by a second pulse that strikes the plasma and creates a flash-bang shockwave to stun and disorient the target. This blast has an area of effect with a 1-meter radius. Anyone caught in the blast must make a SOM x 2 Test (SOM x 3 for synthmorphs or biomorphs with any form of pain tolerance). Failure means the target is temporarily stunned and disoriented and loses their next action. A critical failure means the target is knocked down and paralyzed for 1 Action Turn per 10 points of MoF.

Synthetic morphs and biomorphs with Level 2 Pain Tolerance (or the equivalent) are immune to this weapon. The second setting (colloquially known as the ""roast"" setting) has the same effect of the first, but also actually burns the target, inflicting the listed damage. Originally developed for crowd control, the agonizer is also useful for repelling animals.

Particle Beam Bolter,Bolter,Beam Weapons,"This weapon shoots a bolt of accelerated particles at near light speed that transfer massive amounts of kinetic energy to the target, superheating and creating an explosion when striking. The bolter's beam is not diffused by the cloud that occurs when it strikes, and so it has greater penetration than the laser pulser. Likewise, the bolter is not affected by smoke, fog, or rain. The bolter's beam is invisible. Note that bolters are designed for either atmospheric or exoatmospheric (vacuum) operation, and will not function in the opposite environment (though bulkier dual models, combining both models, are also available).

Antimatter Grenade,,Grenades and Seekers,"Sometimes, Firewall operatives are faced with a situation where defeating an exsurgent threat is impossible and total destruction of the incursion is the only effective option. Antimatter grenades are ideal tools for this task. This weapon comes in two versions, large and small. The large grenade contains 0.1 grams of antimatter, which is sufficient to create a 5-kiloton blast. In its standard setting, the explosion destroys everything within 1 kilometer of the device, and causes severe damage for up to 2 kilometers. This device will completely destroy any habitat up to 5 kilometers across. The small grenade contains 0.0002 grams of antimatter, which is sufficient to create a blast equivalent to 10 tons of TNT. In its standard setting, the explosion destroys everything within 150 meters of the device and severe damage for up to 300 meters. Both weapons can blast a hole through the hull of any habitat and will destroy any spacecraft they are detonated on. Antimatter grenades are highly illegal almost everywhere and possession of one is grounds for severe punishment in most of the solar system. Both weapons can also be set to generate a brief but intense magnetic field a fraction of a second before the blast, which somewhat directs the explosion. Used in this manner, the large device has a blast radius that only extends 400 meters in the protected direction, and the small device has a blast radius that only extends 60 meters in the protected direction. The large antimatter grenade has a mass of 3 kilograms and is a rounded box roughly 10 centimeters on a side; the small antimatter grenade has a mass of 0.5 kilograms and is a box roughly 5 centimeters on a side. Both of these devices can only be detonated using a mini-sized detonator containing a tiny qubit reservoir that contains a QE comm, which transmits to the tiny qubit reservoir in the device. The device can be detonated immediately or set to go off at a predetermined time. The user can also deactivate the device at any time before it explodes.

More than one Hypercorp outpost on Mars has done a shift change only to find that displeased Nomads or Barsoomians placed javelins in the chest of the night crew.",,,FALSE,SEED,,,,,,,,Exotic Ranged Weapon: Spear,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
Liberator Assault Rifle,Liberator,Kinetic Weapons,"The right arm of the Autonomist world, the Liberator model was produced after the Battle of Locus, and has spread to a majority of Anarchist militias in the outer system. The model has also begun appearing in the hands of militant Barsoomians on Mars. The Liberator is a balanced, model designed for fighting in close-quarters on space habs, but keeps most of it's range for ""repelling boarders"". While slightly more complex than most PSC designs, the Liberator is still fairly modular and easy to assemble, ready to go to defend liberty and autonomy. Decrease the max range of this weapon by 10%.",,,FALSE,SEED,,,,,,,,Kinetic Weapons,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
Lightning Gun,,Beam Weapons,"Known by a variety of names, such as ""EL Rifle"", ""Heavy Stunner"", ""Shock Rifle"" or ""Ghostbuster"", the Lightning Gun is a high-power electrolaser based on the same principle as a Stunner, but utilizes a more intense laser and higher power capacitors to bring a more powerful shock to the target. While the primary purpose of a Stunner is an incapacitating shock, the Lightning Gun is classified as a nominal lethal weapon, like military-grade Portal Denial Systems, and electroshock effects are purely secondary. In proper conditions, the lightning gun causes enough air displacement to make a sharp ""crack"" or ""boom"" sound, which while not as intense as natural lightning, is still similar enough to lend the weapon it's most common name. While most stunners are small or medium sized weapons, the Lightning Gun is fully rifle sized. Like a Stunner, it does not operate in vacuum.

Longinus Sniper Rifle,Longinus,Kinetic Weapons,"The Longinus is a high impact Sniper Rifle made for law enforcement and security purposes. It has precision components, a heavy barrel, attached bipod and precision stock, and an increased magazine capacity, all to deliver maximum accuracy and control at range. Commonly, this weapon is paired with accushot ammo for maximum precision at a distance. Of course, this comes at a price, the Longinus is heavy and expensive, and critics consider the weapon over-engineered for marksman purposes, but it still remains popular with Police Snipers in the LLA and Martian City-States. The Longinus comes with a variable (x6/x8/x10) Imaging scope. Increase maximum range of this weapon by 20%, but this weapon cannot be fired while in melee combat.",,,FALSE,SEED,,,,,,,,Kinetic Weapons,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
Outback Hawk Heavy Pistol,Outback Hawk,Kinetic Weapons,"The quintessential ScumTek weapon design, the Outback Hawk is a slightly over-sized heavy pistol model which features an even larger caliber round and ""personalized"" blend of ignition brick. This means the weapon packs a bigger punch than even a normal heavy pistol. The downside is that the weapon requires even more recoil compensation technology than normal, which means that automatic and burst fire mechanisms had to be removed to make room, and the larger size of ammunition means less overall magazine capacity. A common field modification is to replace these functions, though this is known to produce a marked decrease in accuracy. The use of specialized caseless material means there is not a railgun version of this weapon. Increase range of this weapon by 50%.",,,FALSE,SEED,,,,,,,,Kinetic Weapons,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
Penetrator Missile,,Seekers,"This type of seeker (not grenade) utilizes a single, solid kinetic penetrator with a drive encased in a discarding sabot, which maximizes the force of the Seeker Weapon into a small, dense package. These penetrators are made of dense, heavy metals similar to AP ammo in regular kinetic weapons. They produce no area effect, but strike single targets with great penetrating force. This does mean, however, they tend to cause overall less damage to a target. While nothing special in most Seeker weapons, full-size weapons or vehicle mounts often find this greater penetration useful due to their larger projectiles.",,,FALSE,SEED,,,,,,,,Seeker Weapons,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE
Pneumatic Spear,,Melee Weapons,"A truly exotic weapon, the Pneumatic Spear is a collapsing design with a powerful pneumatic system attached to it. This allows it to collapse and extend with great force. Normally, the weapon is a slightly heavier than normal spear, with a larger blade. The increased mass makes it slightly more damaging to use, but the true advantage is when it is extended. When used in an attack while extending (Collapsing or extending takes a Quick Action), the spear generates extreme force, adding 1d10 to DV, and increasing AP by 4. This more advanced construction, sadly makes the spears more complex and expensive, which when combined with the increased weight often makes them impractical.",,,FALSE,SEED,,,,,,,,Exotic Ranged Weapon: Spear,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
Power Fist,,Melee Weapons,"A high-power unarmed weapon which uses the same technology as the Pneumatic Limbs augmentation. It's favored by a few martial artists and sportsmen, or some particularly aggressive or vindictive security forces. It takes the form of a massive gauntlet with a strike-plate hooked to some high-pressure pneumatic cylinders. When an impact is made with the gauntlet, the cylinders release concentrating a lot of force into a small space. The gauntlets are so hefty that most users only wear one at a time, and their bulk grants a -10 penalty to all tests using the gloved hand, but offer an additional 1/3 AV to that arm. Scoring an excellent success with the Power Fist also forces the target to make a SOM x3 test or be knocked down, as if they had taken a wound.

Sica PDP,,Kinetic Weapons,"The Sica model is a light pistol model which uses the same type of ammunition as the Arma PDW. While it lacks a lot of ""stopping power"" compared to most pistols, the weapon has phenomenal armor penetration for such a light pistol, and may be more useful in situations with armored enemies. The pistol also has low recoil making it fairly good for target or competition shooting also. This weapon only uses AP ammunition.",,,FALSE,SEED,,,,,,,,Kinetic Weapons,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
Spear,,Melee Weapons,"Basic spears come in a wide variety, from sharpened bamboo shafts, to pipes with chipped glass taped to the end, to fine pieces of authentic wood and polished steel blades. Despite their relative ease of construction, they are still a rare sight excepting among neoprimitivists or practitioners of select martial arts. They are, however, still a decently reliable weapon, useful for gaining reach on one's opponent.",,,FALSE,SEED,,,,,,,,Exotic Ranged Weapon: Spear,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
Sunburst Plasma Rifle,Sunburst Rifle,Beam Weapons,"In terms of power and utility, almost all accept that the Plasma Rifle is the primary type of weapon, with Plasma's thermal damage unlikely to breach many outer pressure hulls and having advantages against rogue nanotech. PSC produces a ""slim"" model with better energy efficiency which produces a lighter induction of plasma, meaning it doesn't hit as hard, but is less expensive to construct and easier on the outputs. It also features a reserve battery system, so it can hold two batteries at once meaning it can be switched between the two as a Quick Action, but both can be completely replaced in one Complex Action. Decrease the maximum range of this weapon by 20%, reduce the penalty for the Attacker being in Melee by 10.",,,FALSE,SEED,,,,,,,,Beam Weapons,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
Vajra Plasma Rifle,Vajra Rifle,Beam Weapons,"Another tool common to the Purifiers among the Ultimates based around the Pandora Gates, the Vajra is a powerful model which pushes the capabilities of a Plasma Rifle with cutting edge magnetic focused systems. This gives it a slightly better range and kinetic force when fired. The Vajra also has cutting edge heat sinks, meaning it can be fired in Vacuum for an additional round before needing to cool. Vajras also come equipped with Nuclear Batteries at all times to build back up power at all times. This also makes them maintenance heavy and complex to repair. Increase maximum range on this weapon by 10%.",,,FALSE,SEED,,,,,,,,Beam Weapons,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
Viper Sword,,Melee Weapons,"The big brother of the Wasp Knife, the Viper Sword doesn't cause as much harm as a Vibroblade or Monofilament Sword, but has one advantage in the form of an internal arterial structure. When combined with a triple-cartridge system in the base of the weapon, this allows the Viper Sword to be almost instantaneously coated in any Toxin, Chemical or Nanotoxin from storage. It can also be used to cause damage in pressure differential situations like a Wasp Knife, though this requires a stabbing motion rather than a slash to apply. The Viper Sword has a series of three canisters which hold three separate doses of a drug or chemical substance. To apply the effects the target must suffer damage.",,,FALSE,SEED,,,,,,,,Blades,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
