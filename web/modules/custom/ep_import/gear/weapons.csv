Rail Sniper Rifle,weapon,2d10+8,-15,,SA,12,Kinetic Weapons,FALSE,Expensive,,"Sniper rifles are optimized for range, accuracy, penetration, and stopping power. They fire in semi-auto, burst fire, or full auto modes, and are two-handed weapons.",,
Rail Machine Gun,weapon,2d10+8,-7,,"BF, FA",50,Kinetic Weapons,FALSE,Expensive,,"Machine guns are heavy weapons, typically mounted, and intended to provide continuous fire for support or suppressive purposes. They fire in burst fire or full auto modes, and are two-handed weapons.",,
Plasma Rifle,weapon,3d10+20,-8,,SA,10,Beam Weapons,FALSE,Expensive,,"This bulky, heavy, two-handed weapon blasts a stream of nova-hot plasma at the target, inflicting severe burns and thermal damage, possibly melting or evaporating the target entirely. Plasma rifles are perhaps the deadliest man-portable weapons in use. Plasma guns suffer from dangerous overheating in vacuum, however, and so require 1 full Action Turn of cool-down time after every 2 shots. Plasma rifles only fire in semi-auto mode.",,
Antimatter Grenade,weapon,100d10,-99,,,Grenade,Demolitions,FALSE,Crazypants,,"Sometimes, Firewall operatives are faced with a situation where defeating an exsurgent threat is impossible and total destruction of the incursion is the only effective option. Antimatter grenades are ideal tools for this task. This weapon comes in two versions, large and small. The large grenade contains 0.1 grams of antimatter, which is sufficient to create a 5-kiloton blast. In its standard setting, the explosion destroys everything within 1 kilometer of the device, and causes severe damage for up to 2 kilometers. This device will completely destroy any habitat up to 5 kilometers across. The small grenade contains 0.0002 grams of antimatter, which is sufficient to create a blast equivalent to 10 tons of TNT. In its standard setting, the explosion destroys everything within 150 meters of the device and severe damage for up to 300 meters. Both weapons can blast a hole through the hull of any habitat and will destroy any spacecraft they are detonated on. Antimatter grenades are highly illegal almost everywhere and possession of one is grounds for severe punishment in most of the solar system. Both weapons can also be set to generate a brief but intense magnetic field a fraction of a second before the blast, which somewhat directs the explosion. Used in this manner, the large device has a blast radius that only extends 400 meters in the protected direction, and the small device has a blast radius that only extends 60 meters in the protected direction. The large antimatter grenade has a mass of 3 kilograms and is a rounded box roughly 10 centimeters on a side; the small antimatter grenade has a mass of 0.5 kilograms and is a box roughly 5 centimeters on a side. Both of these devices can only be detonated using a mini-sized detonator containing a tiny qubit reservoir that contains a QE comm, which transmits to the tiny qubit reservoir in the device. The device can be detonated immediately or set to go off at a predetermined time. The user can also deactivate the device at any time before it explodes. Because of the massive destruction involved, Firewall only uses these devices as a last resort. Antimatter grenades are handled with Demolitions skill.",,
EMP,grenade,,,,,,,TRUE,High,,"EMP munitions fire off a strong electromagnetic pulse when they detonate. Since most electronics in Eclipse Phase are built with optical technology, and power supplies and sensitive microcircuits are shielded and surge-protected, this has no major damaging effect. Antennas, however, are vulnerable, especially finer wires like those used with mesh inserts. As a result, the primary effect of EMP is to disable radio communications""""every radio within range of the blast is reduced to 1/10th the normal range. The base blast radius for EMP is 50 meters.",,
Plasmaburst,grenade,3d10+10,-6,,,,,TRUE,High,,"Also called hellballs, these munitions release a burst of plasma upon detonation that causes searing heat and fire damage across the area of effect without the devastating shockwaves of explosions that might rebound in an enclosed environment and/or breach a habitat's infrastructure.",,
Thermobaric,grenade,3d10+5,-10,,,,,TRUE,High,,"Thermobaric grenades and seekers utilize a more deadly form of explosion. When they detonate, they disperse a cloud of aerosol explosive over an area and then ignite, literally setting the air on fire, generating a devastating pressure wave, and sucking the oxygen out of the area. Thermobarics use the rules for uniform blast.",,
Plasma Blade,weapon,2d10+8,-8,,,,Blades,TRUE,High,,"Not really a sword, per se, the plasma sword is a sort of specialized plasma torch. A lengthened c-shaped framework above the handle uses a laser and magnetic coils to stabilize a ""beam"" of ionized, superheated gas (plasma). The open sides of the framework allow the ""sword"" to be used as a superheated cutting implement. Though dangerous to wield in melee, it is sometimes favored as a weapon against heavily armored exsur- gents by some sentinels. Plasma swords are wielded using Blades skill.",,
Sniper Rifle,weapon,2d10+6,-12,,SA,12,Kinetic Weapons,TRUE,High,,"Sniper rifles are optimized for range, accuracy, penetration, and stopping power. They fire in semi-auto, burst fire, or full auto modes, and are two-handed weapons.",,

Rail Automatic Rifle,weapon,2d10+8,-9,,"SA, BF, FA",30,Kinetic Weapons,TRUE,High,,"Automatic rifles use rifle ammunition and have greater range and penetration than SMGs. They fire in semi-auto, burst fire, or full auto modes. They are two-handed weapons.",,
Particle Beam Bolter,weapon,2d10+4,-2,,SA,50,Beam Weapons,TRUE,High,,"This weapon shoots a bolt of accelerated particles at near light speed that transfer massive amounts of kinetic energy to the target, superheating and creating an explosion when striking. The bolter's beam is not diffused by the cloud that occurs when it strikes, and so it has greater penetration than the laser pulser. Likewise, the bolter is not affected by smoke, fog, or rain. The bolter's beam is invisible. Note that bolters are designed for either atmospheric or exoatmospheric (vacuum) operation, and will not function in the opposite environment (though bulkier dual models, combining both models, are also available). Bolters fire in semi-auto mode and are rifle-sized two-handed weapons.",,
Minimissile Seeker Rifle,weapon,,,,SA,6,Seeker Weapons,TRUE,High,,The seeker rifle comes in a bullpup configuration and fires either micromissiles or minimissiles in semi-auto mode. It is a two-handed weapons.,,

Reactive,ammo,2,-2,,,,,TRUE,High,,"The casing on these projectiles is made of reactive materials that release a large amount of energy when subjected to a sudden shock or impact""""such as striking a target. In other words, they explode or superheat when they hit.""",,
Gas/Smoke,grenade,,,,,,,TRUE,Low,,"Gas/smoke munitions emit a cloud of their contained substance. Smoke impedes sight by releasing thick fumes upon ignition of the seeker. The smoke can be of any color and is often heated (called thermal smoke) to obfuscate heat signatures moving through the smoke as cover. Note that gases dissipate much more quickly under certain environmental conditions (wind, rain, etc.)",,
Splash,grenade,,,,,,,TRUE,Low,," Splash rounds spread a contained substance (drug, chemical, nanoswarm, paint) over a base 10-meter blast radius when they detonate.",,
Diamond Ax,weapon,2d10+3,-3,,,,Blades,TRUE,Low,,"Commonly found on many habitats for fire and emergency purposes, axes require two hands to wield. Their blades are diamond-coated for superior cutting ability.",,
Flex Cutter,weapon,1d10+3,-1,,,,Blades,TRUE,Low,,"The blade of this machete-like weapon is made of a memory polymer. When deactivated, the blade is limp and flexible, and may even be rolled up or otherwise easily concealed. When activated, however, the blade stiffens and sharpens into a vicious slashing weapon.",,
Monofilament Sword,weapon,2d10+2,-4,,,,Blades,TRUE,Low,,"Though swords are rather archaic in the time of Eclipse Phase, a few eccentrics take advantage of modern versions with a self-sharpening near-monomolecular edge, easily capable of slicing through metal or limbs.",,
Vibroblade,weapon,2d10,-2,,,,Blades,TRUE,Low,,"These buzzing electronic blades vibrate at a high frequency for extra cutting ability. This has little extra effect when stabbing or slashing, but provides an extra -3 AP and +2d10 damage when carefully sawing through something.",,
Wasp Knife,weapon,1d10+2,-1,,,,Blades,TRUE,Low,,"Wasp knives are equipped with a canister in their handle. The common use is to fill these canisters with pressured air, which inflates inside the target. This is potentially lethal in vacuum or pressurized environments (like underwater), as the gas bursts out of the body cavity to escape (+2d10 damage in such situations). Wasp knives may also be loaded with chemicals, drugs, or nanobots. The target must be damaged for the canister's contents to affect them.",,
Shock Baton,weapon,1d10+2+Shock,,,,,Clubs,TRUE,Low,,"Shock batons are standard clubs used for policing duties, but when activated they also deliver an electric shock to struck targets.",,
Shock Gloves,weapon,1d10+Shock,,,,,Unarmed Combat,TRUE,Low,,"When activated, these gloves deliver an incapacitating shock along with every punch or grab. Note that the effect is the same whether wearing one glove or two.",,
Light Pistol,weapon,2d10,,,"SA, BF, FA",16,Kinetic Weapons,TRUE,Low,,"Pistols are small-sized and designed for one-hand use. Light pistols sacrifice penetrating ability for concealability.

Shard,weapon,1d10+6,-10,,"SA,BF,SA",100,Spray Weapons,TRUE,Low,,"The shard pistol is a flechette weapon, firing a stream of of diamondoid monomolecular shards at high velocities. These micro flechettes are very good at penetrating armor, but they do not disperse kinetic energy well and so do not cause as much tissue damage as kinetic weapons. Shard ammunition is often coated with drugs or toxins for extra efficiency.",,

Flux,ammo,,,,,,,TRUE,Low,,"Flux ammo is made from rheological materials that allow each bullet to be """"programmed"""" so that they may change from regular rounds to less-lethal soft plastic-like rounds. This allows the firer to choose the type of round (regular or plastic) made with each shot or burst, and then change with the next one.""",,
Biter,ammo,+1d10,,,,,,TRUE,Low,," Biters are specially-designed to fragment in opposite proportion to the hardness of the target they strike. For hard targets (synthmorphs), they fragment very little, blasting a big hole. For soft targets (biomorphs), they fragment and tumble in multiple directions within the body.",,
Bug,ammo,-1d10,1,,,,,TRUE,Low,,"Bug rounds are equipped with a microbug and medical sensor nanobots. They attempt to gather information on the target's location (via standard mesh tracking), health (querying the target's medichines), and surroundings (typically hindered by being inside the target's body). They will transmit status reports in a pre-programmed manner via the mesh or a pre-chosen frequency band either continuously or in pre-set intervals.",,
Accushot,ammo,,,,,,,TRUE,Low,,"Accushot bullets change shape within flight to keep dead on course, countering the effects of wind, drag, and gravity over distance. Attacks made with accushot bullets ignore all range modifiers.",,
Homing,ammo,,,10,,,,TRUE,Low,,"When fired with a smartlink system, the bullet identifies the target and uses nanosensors to lock on, correcting the bullet's trajectory with surface alterations and tiny vectored nozzles. Apply a +10 modifier to the Attack Test, cumulative with aiming and smartlink modifiers. Homing bullets may also be used for indirect fire.",,
Laser-Guided,ammo,,,10,,,,TRUE,Low,,"These bullets function like homing smart rounds (apply the +10 attack modifier), except rather than requiring a smartlink system, they lock onto the reflection of the laser sight used to paint the target. Laser-guided bullets may also be used for indirect fire.",,
Zero,ammo,,,,,,,TRUE,Low,,"Similar to homing smart rounds, zero bullets identify the target when fired via smartlink. Whether the round hits or misses, however, it sends telemetry data back to the next zero bullet, allowing it to course-correct and """"zero in"""" to hit the target (or hit more accurately). Apply a +10 modifier to each shot (or burst) fired after the first against the same target in the same Action Turn.""",,
Flayer,ammo,2,,,,,,TRUE,Low,," Flayers have nanosensors to detect an oncoming impact, shooting out monomolecular barbs as they are about to strike a target. These monowires cut through the target along with the bullet, inflicting additional damage.",,
Armor-Piercing,ammo,-2,-5,,,,,TRUE,Low,, This tungsten-carbide ammunition penetrates armor effectively.,,

Laser Sight,accessory,,,10,,,,TRUE,Low,,"This underbarrel laser emits a beam that places a glowing red dot on the target to assist targeting. Apply a +10 modifier to Attack Tests (not cumulative with a smartlink modifier). Laser sights may also be used to paint a target for laser-guided smart ammo or seekers. Infrared and ultraviolet lasers are also available, so that the dot is only visible to characters able to see in those spectrums.",,
Safety System,accessory,,,,,,,TRUE,Low,,"A biometric (palmprint or voiceprint) or ego ID sensor is embedded in the weapon, disabling it if anyone other than an authorized user attempts to fire it.",,
Concussion,grenade,1d10/2,,,,,,TRUE,Moderate,,"These devices emit a concussive blast designed to knock opponents off their feet and stun them. Any character caught within a base blast radius of 10 meters must make a SOM x 2 Test. If they fail, they are knocked down.

Overload,grenade,1d10/2,-99,,,,,TRUE,Moderate,,"Overload grenades and seekers launch an all-out assault on the target's sensory spectrum. This attack includes blinding by intense flashing light, a deafening thunderclap followed by intense ultrasonic screaming, nausea-inducing malodorants, and infra-sonic frequencies that can trigger unpleasant emotional responses (anxiety, uneasiness, extreme sorrow, nervous feelings of revulsion or fear). For an extra kick, overloads are also packed with """"stingballs""""""""rubber pellets that inflict pain when detonated near an under-armored target. Anyone caught in the base 10-meter blast radius must make a SOM + WIL Test. If they fail, they must immediately leave the area of effect. If they fail with an MoF of 30+, they are incapacitated for 3 Action Turns with disorientation and/or vomiting, after which they must roll again. Overload munitions remain in effect for 1 full minute. Anyone in the area of effect suffers a -30 action modifier, which reduces by 10 per Action Turn after they leave the area. Additionally, anyone facing the direction of the overload round suffers a -10 glare modifier (neutralized by anti-glare systems).",,
Monowire Garrote,weapon,3d10,-8,,,,Exotic Melee Weapons: Monowire Garrote,TRUE,Moderate,,"This assassin's weapon features a dangerous monomolecular wire wrapped around a contained spool with two handles. One handle grips the spool, while the other extends the wire so that it may be used to wrap around targets (typically necks or limbs) and slice through them when pulled.

Laser Pulser,weapon,2d10,,,"SA, SS",50,Beam Weapons,TRUE,Moderate,,"Laser weapons use focused beams of light to inflict damage on the target by burning into it and causing it's outer surface to vaporize and expand, creating an explosive effect. The laser beam is pulsed in order to bite into the target before the beam is diffused. Pulsers are vulnerable to atmospheric effects like dust, mist, smoke, or rain, however""""the gamemaster should reduce their effective range categories as appropriate. Note that laser pulses are invisible in the normal visual spectrum (but are visible to characters with enhanced vision). Pulsers are medium-sized and fire in semi-auto mode. One advantage to the pulser is that it can be placed in less-lethal mode. In this case, it first fires a pulse at the target to create a ball of plasma, quickly fired by a second pulse that strikes the plasma and creates a flash-bang shockwave to stun and disorient the target. This blast has an area of effect with a 1-meter radius. Anyone caught in the blast must make a SOM x 2 Test (SOM x 3 for synthmorphs or biomorphs with any form of pain tolerance). Failure means the target is temporarily stunned and disoriented and loses their next action. A critical failure means the target is knocked down and paralyzed for 1 Action Turn per 10 points of MoF. In this stun setting, the pulser fires only in single-shot mode.",,
Microwave Agonizer,weapon,2d10,-5,,SA,50,Beam Weapons,TRUE,Moderate,,"The agonizer fires millimeter-wave beams that create an unpleasant burning sensation in skin (even through armor) and to metals. Agonizers have two settings. The first is an active denial setting that causes extreme burning pain in the target, inflicting -20 to the target's actions and forcing them to move away from the beam on their next action unless they succeed in a WIL Test (targets with Level 1 Pain Tolerance or the equivalent only suffer a -10 modifier and roll WIL x 2). Synthetic morphs and biomorphs with Level 2 Pain Tolerance (or the equivalent) are immune to this weapon. The second setting (colloquially known as the ""roast"" setting) has the same effect of the first, but also actually burns the target, inflicting the listed damage. Originally developed for crowd control, the agonizer is also useful for repelling animals. The agonizer is small-sized and fires in semi-auto mode.",,
Stunner,weapon,1d10/2 shock,,,SA,200,Beam Weapons,TRUE,Moderate,,"The stunner is an electrolaser that creates an electrically-conductive plasma channel to the target, down which it transmits a powerful electric current, shocking the target.

Buzzer,weapon,Nanoswarm,,,SS,3,Spray Weapons,TRUE,Moderate,,"Equipped with a specialized nanobot hive, Buzzers are used to spray a nanoswarm on a target or area. They have a limited capacity of swarms, though the nanohive can construct one new swarm each hour. This weapon is two-handed.",,
Freezer,weapon,Incapacitation,,,SA,20,Spray Weapons,TRUE,Moderate,,"Freezers spew out a fast-hardening foam that immediately begins to harden. They are primarily used as a non-lethal method of immobilizing or securing a target. Struck characters must immediately make a REF x 3 Test or become trapped. Apply a -30 modifier to this test if the attacker scored an Excellent Success (MoS 30+). The foam allows characters to breath even if their mouth and nose are covered, but it may impede sight. Freezer foam can be spiked with contact toxins or drugs to additionally sedate the target. It can also be used to construct temporary barricades or cover.
