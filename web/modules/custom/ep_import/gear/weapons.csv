Laser Pulser,Beam Weapons,"Laser weapons use focused beams of light to inflict damage on the target by burning into it and causing it's outer surface to vaporize and expand, creating an explosive effect. The laser beam is pulsed in order to bite into the target before the beam is diffused. Pulsers are vulnerable to atmospheric effects like dust, mist, smoke, or rain, however—the gamemaster should reduce their effective range categories as appropriate. Note that laser pulses are invisible in the normal visual spectrum (but are visible to characters with enhanced vision). Pulsers are medium-sized and fire in semi-auto mode. One advantage to the pulser is that it can be placed in less-lethal mode. In this case, it first fires a pulse at the target to create a ball of plasma, quickly fired by a second pulse that strikes the plasma and creates a flash-bang shockwave to stun and disorient the target. This blast has an area of effect with a 1-meter radius. Anyone caught in the blast must make a SOM x 2 Test (SOM x 3 for synthmorphs or biomorphs with any form of pain tolerance). Failure means the target is temporarily stunned and disoriented and loses their next action. A critical failure means the target is knocked down and paralyzed for 1 Action Turn per 10 points of MoF.

The first is an active denial setting that causes extreme burning pain in the target, inflicting -20 to the target's actions and forcing them to move away from the beam on their next action unless they succeed in a WIL Test (targets with Level 1 Pain Tolerance or the equivalent only suffer a -10 modifier and roll WIL x 2). Synthetic morphs and biomorphs with Level 2 Pain Tolerance (or the equivalent) are immune to this weapon. The second setting (colloquially known as the ""roast"" setting) has the same effect of the first, but also actually burns the target, inflicting the listed damage. Originally developed for crowd control, the agonizer is also useful for repelling animals.

Particle Beam Bolter,Beam Weapons,"This weapon shoots a bolt of accelerated particles at near light speed that transfer massive amounts of kinetic energy to the target, superheating and creating an explosion when striking. The bolter's beam is not diffused by the cloud that occurs when it strikes, and so it has greater penetration than the laser pulser. Likewise, the bolter is not affected by smoke, fog, or rain. The bolter's beam is invisible. Note that bolters are designed for either atmospheric or exoatmospheric (vacuum) operation, and will not function in the opposite environment (though bulkier dual models, combining both models, are also available).

Antimatter Grenade,Grenades and Seekers,"Sometimes, Firewall operatives are faced with a situation where defeating an exsurgent threat is impossible and total destruction of the incursion is the only effective option. Antimatter grenades are ideal tools for this task. This weapon comes in two versions, large and small. The large grenade contains 0.1 grams of antimatter, which is sufficient to create a 5-kiloton blast. In its standard setting, the explosion destroys everything within 1 kilometer of the device, and causes severe damage for up to 2 kilometers. This device will completely destroy any habitat up to 5 kilometers across. The small grenade contains 0.0002 grams of antimatter, which is sufficient to create a blast equivalent to 10 tons of TNT. In its standard setting, the explosion destroys everything within 150 meters of the device and severe damage for up to 300 meters. Both weapons can blast a hole through the hull of any habitat and will destroy any spacecraft they are detonated on. Antimatter grenades are highly illegal almost everywhere and possession of one is grounds for severe punishment in most of the solar system. Both weapons can also be set to generate a brief but intense magnetic field a fraction of a second before the blast, which somewhat directs the explosion. Used in this manner, the large device has a blast radius that only extends 400 meters in the protected direction, and the small device has a blast radius that only extends 60 meters in the protected direction. The large antimatter grenade has a mass of 3 kilograms and is a rounded box roughly 10 centimeters on a side; the small antimatter grenade has a mass of 0.5 kilograms and is a box roughly 5 centimeters on a side. Both of these devices can only be detonated using a mini-sized detonator containing a tiny qubit reservoir that contains a QE comm, which transmits to the tiny qubit reservoir in the device. The device can be detonated immediately or set to go off at a predetermined time. The user can also deactivate the device at any time before it explodes.

Hand Shockwave,,"Another variant on the Hand Laser, this weapon is functionally identical to the normal base Hand Laser except that the internal construction is deliberately made so it only fires in what is normally ""Stun"" mode on a Laser Pulser. It uses a two-step laser pulse to generate shockwaves of plasma which erupt in a 1 meter radius of the target, similar to a flashbang, disorienting and knocking aside the target. Such PEP weapons are commonly used by law enforcement, and some prefer this type of approach in implanted weapons. All targets in the area of effect must make SOM x2 tests (SOM x3 for Synthmorphs or morphs with Pain Tolerance), failure meaning they are temporarily stunned and lose their next Action. Critical Failure results in the target being knocked down and being completely paralyzed for 1 Action Turn per 10 MoF.

Lightning Gun,,"Known by a variety of names, such as ""EL Rifle"", ""Heavy Stunner"", ""Shock Rifle"" or ""Ghostbuster"", the Lightning Gun is a high-power electrolaser based on the same principle as a Stunner, but utilizes a more intense laser and higher power capacitors to bring a more powerful shock to the target. While the primary purpose of a Stunner is an incapacitating shock, the Lightning Gun is classified as a nominal lethal weapon, like military-grade Portal Denial Systems, and electroshock effects are purely secondary. In proper conditions, the lightning gun causes enough air displacement to make a sharp ""crack"" or ""boom"" sound, which while not as intense as natural lightning, is still similar enough to lend the weapon it's most common name.

Underbarrel Torch,Weapon Accessories,"The Underbarrel Torch is a compact, torch-like weapon system which mounts to the underside of a rifle- or SMG -sized weapon, similar to the Underbarrel Seeker (p. 340 EP).

Any target hit by an attack which was an Excellent Success is set On Fire, and will take 2d10 DV per Action Turn until it is put out. Similar to the Torch, the flames will not persist long if deprived of oxygen. While torches are seen as utility tools in several habs to handle pest control (both organic and nanotech varieties), the Underbarrel Torch is often more restrictive, due to it's compact nature and association with combat weapons.",,,,,,,,,,,,Spray Weapons,,,,,,,
Hand Stunner,,"Similar to the Hand Laser, this implant embeds an electrolaser through flexible components in the forearm, with the lens aperture emerging between knuckles on the dominant hand.

Because of the lower power, the Hand Stunner has better efficiency than a Hand Laser, but still less than an external Stunner, holding a total of 100 shots.

It takes the form of a massive gauntlet with a strike-plate hooked to some high-pressure pneumatic cylinders. When an impact is made with the gauntlet, the cylinders release concentrating a lot of force into a small space. The gauntlets are so hefty that most users only wear one at a time, and their bulk grants a -10 penalty to all tests using the gloved hand, but offer an additional 1/3 AV to that arm. Scoring an excellent success with the Power Fist also forces the target to make a SOM x3 test or be knocked down, as if they had taken a wound. ",,,,,,,,,,,,Unarmed Combat,,,,,,,
Penetrator Missile,,"This type of seeker (not grenade) utilizes a single, solid kinetic penetrator with a drive encased in a discarding sabot, which maximizes the force of the Seeker Weapon into a small, dense package. These penetrators are made of dense, heavy metals similar to AP ammo in regular kinetic weapons. They produce no area effect, but strike single targets with great penetrating force.

Pneumatic Spear,,"A truly exotic weapon, the Pneumatic Spear is a collapsing design with a powerful pneumatic system attached to it. This allows it to collapse and extend with great force. Normally, the weapon is a slightly heavier than normal spear, with a larger blade. The increased mass makes it slightly more damaging to use, but the true advantage is when it is extended. When used in an attack while extending (Collapsing or extending takes a Quick Action), the spear generates extreme force, adding 1d10 to DV, and increasing AP by 4.

Outback Hawk Heavy Pistol,,"The quintessential ScumTek weapon design, the Outback Hawk is a slightly over-sized heavy pistol model which features an even larger caliber round and ""personalized"" blend of ignition brick. This means the weapon packs a bigger punch than even a normal heavy pistol. The downside is that the weapon requires even more recoil compensation technology than normal, which means that automatic and burst fire mechanisms had to be removed to make room, and the larger size of ammunition means less overall magazine capacity. A common field modification is to replace these functions, though this is known to produce a marked decrease in accuracy. The use of specialized caseless material means there is not a railgun version of this weapon. Increase range of this weapon by 50%.",,,,,,,,,,,,Kinetic Weapons,,,,,,,
"""Oozer"" Machine Pistol",,"Another ScumTek design made popular my modern crime and action vids, the Oozer is an attempt to build a cheap, small automatic weapon.
