Ablative Patches,,Armor Mod,"These thin and light slap-on patches of stick to armor and are designed to absorb heat and energy from beams and explosions, safely vaporizing and blowing hot gas away. Ablative patches increases the Armor Value by +4/+2, but each hit reduces both the energy and kinetic value of the ablative armor by 1.",Trivial,,TRUE,,,4/2,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE
Chameleon Coating,,Armor Mod,This provides the armor with the same effect as the chameleon cloak.,Trivial,,TRUE,,+30 Infiltration,,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE
Fireproofing,,Armor Mod,"Fireproofing includes the addition of heat-resistant ceramic or fire-resistant layers, both capable of withstanding extremely high temperatures. Fireproofing increases the Armor Value by +2/+0, and provides an additional 10 points of armor against heat or fire specifically.",Trivial,,TRUE,,"+10 armor vs heat, fire",2/0,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE
Immunogenic System,,Armor Mod,"The immunogenic mod adds an active nanobot swarm, maintained by a specialized hive, that coats the outer layer of armor and also the non-armored parts of the wearer's morph. It acts as an outer immune system designed to neutralize toxic agents and nanotoxins with which it comes into contact. This provides immunity to drugs, toxins, and nanotoxins applied dermally, such as with a slap patch or splash grenade. It has no effect on inhaled, oral, or injected drugs (including coated weapons).",Low,,TRUE,,Immunity to dermal toxins,,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE
Lotus Coating,,Armor Mod,"The armor has been impregnated with a superhydrophic coating (contact angle of around 170) that repels all water-like liquids. If the armor is splashed by liquid toxins or chemicals, the effect is reduced since the liquids starts to roll off the armor. Apply a +30 modifier when defending against liquid-based attacks.",Trivial,,TRUE,,+30 against liquid attacks,,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE
Offensive Armor,,Armor Mod,"When activated, the outer layer of this armor is rigged to shock anyone or anything that contacts it with electricity. Treat its DV and effect as a shock baton.",Low,,TRUE,,,,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE
Reactive Coating,,Armor Mod,"A thick layer of advanced nanotech is applied to the armor, protecting it with a colony of nanobots designed to sense incoming attacks. When an attack strikes the coating, it detonates to disrupt the attack. Bursts and full autofire are treated as a single attack. A reactive coating increases the Armor Value by +5/+5, but each detonation automatically inflicts 1 point of damage on the wearer. Reactive armor also works against melee attacks, but the attacker also suffers 1d10 / 2 (round up) points of damage per attack (armor protects) from the microexplosion. Reactive coating only works against 5 attacks, after which the specialized nanobot hive replenishes the coating at the rate of 1 use per hour.",Moderate,,TRUE,,1d10/2 against melee attacks,5/5,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE

Armor Clothing,,Armor,The extra-resilient organoweave fibers and fullerene materials that offer basic protection against kinetic and energy weapons can be woven in with normal smart materials to create a wide range of discreet armor clothing that provides a subtle level of security. Such protective garments are indistinguishable from regular clothing and come in all styles and designs. Armor clothing provides an Armor Value of 3/4.,Trivial,,TRUE,,,3/4,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE
Armor Vest,,Armor,"Armor vests provide more thorough protection to a body's vital areas, covering the abdomen and torso completely, protecting the neck with a rigid collar, and even providing wrap-under protection for the groin. Though armor vests are not bulky, they are obvious as armor. Armor vests may be worn with armor clothing without penalty. Armor vests provide an Armor Value of 6/6.",Low,,TRUE,,,6/6,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE
Body Armor (Heavy),Heavy Body Armor,Armor,"Similar to light body armor, but with extra protective layers, often ergonomically manufactured to conform to a specific character's body, and an environmental seal with climate control to protect the wearer from hostile environments.",Moderate,,TRUE,,,13/13,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE
Body Armor (Light),Light Body Armor,Armor,"These high performance armor outfits protect the wearer from head to toe. An integrated armor vest is supplemented with increased protection on the limbs and joints, while still managing to be flexible and non-restrictive. Body armor is typically worn by security and police forces, and supplemented with a helmet.",Low,,TRUE,,,10/10,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE
Crash Suit,,Armor,"Designed for both industrial worksite safety and protection from accidental zero-G collisions, crash suits are also favored by sports enthusiasts and explorers. The basic jumpsuit offers comfortable protection equal to that of armor clothing. When activated with an electronic signal, however, elastic polymers within the suit stiffen and form rigid impact protection for vital areas. Crash suits provide an Armor Value of 3/4 when inactive and 4/6 when activated.",Low,,TRUE,,,4/6,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE
Full Helmet,,Armor,"This armor accessory is usually worn with body armor or a battle suit.

Second Skin,,Armor,"This lightweight bodysuit, woven from spider silks and fullerenes, is typically worn as an underlayer, though some athletes use it as a uniform. It provides minimal protection, but may be worn with other armor without penalty. It provides an Armor Value of 1/3.",Low,,TRUE,,,1/3,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
Smart Skin,,Armor,"Smart skin is an advanced nanofluid that covers the wearer's skin. It resembles liquid mercury but retains the texture and flexibility of normal skin until activated, at which point the material becomes rigid enough to protect the wearer and distribute the kinetic energy (though still flexible enough at the joints not to impede movement). A specialized hive, worn by the character, replenishes the nanobots and stores them when not in use. Deploying the nanobots across the body takes a full Action Turn.",Low,,TRUE,,,3/2,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
Smart Vac Clothing,,Vacsuum Suit,"Just like regular smart clothing, this outfit can also transform into a light vacsuit.",Moderate,,TRUE,,,2/4,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE
Spray Armor,,Armor,"This fast armor application comes in a spray can and disperses a smart chemical polymer that sticks to bare flesh (but does not adhere to hair and eyes). The polymer solidifies into a form fitting body armor fabric when exposed to body temperature with the look and feel of a latex suit. Spray armor does not work on synthetic morphs or on clothing or other armor. The color and feel of the armor can be adjusted with electric currents and additional polymers, making it popular among some socialite and nightlife scenes. The spray-on armor does not wash off, but degrades 1 point of armor (both energy and kinetic) every 12 hours. It may be removed with a special nanotech solvent.",Low,,TRUE,,,2/2,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
High-dive suit,,Vacsuum Suit,"High-dive suits are individual spacesuits specifically designed to withstand atmospheric re-entry and allow the occupant to reach a planet's surface safely. They feature a liquid-cooled thermal regulation system, a closed-loop oxygen system with chemical scrubbers, small gas jets, a drogue chute, and a conventional parachute. High-dive suits are made of fullerene with a refractory metal coating and an opaque sapphire faceplate. A mini-oxygen tank and rebreather provide the wearer with 3 hours worth of breathing air. A high-dive suit compares to light body armor in terms of general protection, though its refractive glazing and heat-transfer systems provide extra protection against energy weapons (AV 13/10). Because of its thermal dampening systems, a high-dive suit also makes its wearer difficult to spot with thermal sensors (-30 modifier to Perception Tests), unless they are entering atmosphere, in which case they are difficult to miss (+30). Note that high-dive suits were designed for (unpow-ered) descent only""they are not equipped for any sort of powered flight.",High,,TRUE,,-30 against thermal sensors,13/10,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE
Hard Suit,,Vacsuum Suit,"This heavy-duty suit can almost be considered a miniature space ship. Hard Suits look like large metallic ovals with jointed arms and legs. They are quite heavy, but the user can move relatively easily by using servo assist motors in all the major joints of the arms and legs. Unlike other vacsuits, they are solid and can resist both vacuum and up to 100 atmospheres of external pressure. Characters wearing hard suits can safely explore the upper atmosphere of a gas giant. They are well armored against punctures and radiation and possess miniature plasma thrusters capable of delivering 0.01G for 10 hours. A built-in high quality maker produces sufficient food, air, and water that a user can remain in a hard suit indefinitely. Explorers have used them continuously for up to 2 months. Their gloves incorporate smart materials that allow each hand to use the equivalent of a utilitool. Hard suits also contain radios and sensors equivalent to those on standard vacsuits. These suits have an Armor rating of 15/15, are maintained by a fixer nanohive, and are instantly self-sealing of any breach unless more than 30 points of damage are inflicted at once. They protect the wearer from temperatures of -200 to 180 C.",High,,TRUE,,,15/15,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE
Mercury Suit,,Vacsuum Suit,"These modified hard suits feature extreme heat and radiation shielding, enabling an occupant to survive on Mercury's surface under both day and night conditions. They have all of the standard features of hard suits except that they can with-stand temperatures of -200 to 500 C. The extra protection hinders the wearer's movement; reduce Movement rate by half and apply a -10 modifier to all COO-linked tests.",Expensive,,FALSE,,-10 COO,15/15,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE
Venus Suit,,Vacsuum Suit,"Venus suits have the same characteristics as Mercury suits, plus they are specially modified to protect a biomorph from the crushing pressure on Venus's surface.",Expensive,,FALSE,,-10 COO,15/15,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE
Solar Survival Suits,,Vacsuum Suit,"Solar survival suits are hard suits with special modi-fications, equivalent to the coronal adaptation trait. The survival suit also possesses an extremely powerful emergency beacon, strong enough to punch through the sun's electromagnetic background roar. The built-in maker provides enough air, water, and food for the wearer to survive indefinitely. Solar survival suits provide armor of AV 20/15. In the event that a survivor is subjected to a coronal mass ejection, the suit's effectiveness is drastically reduced. Subjected to high density plasma with temperatures reaching tens of millions Kelvins, the suit will only protect the wearer for a few seconds at best""just long enough for a survivor to access their ",Expensive,,FALSE,,,20/15,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE
Vacsuit (Light Smartfabric),Light Smartfabric Vacsuit,Vacsuum Suit,"Everyone living in a sealed habitat owns at least one of these suits. They come in a variety of forms. Inexpensive versions are typically lightweight jumpsuits made of simple smart fabric that adjusts to fit and folds up small enough to fit into a coat pocket. The best models include suits of high-end smart clothing that can transform into a vacsuit and an advanced nanotech generator the size of a large orange that deploy nanobots that cover the user and  t together into a vacuum suit. Both can transform into a vacsuit in 2 full Action Turns and do so either on command or if their sensors reveal that life support is needed. All models include a lightweight belt or torc containing a miniature oxygen tank and advanced rebreather unit that provides 3 hours of air. However, the suits contain no food or water recycling. All models include an ecto and a headlight, but typically little else beyond atmosphere sensors to let the wearer know when it is safe to take off the suit. They protect the wearer from temperatures from -75 to 100 C.
