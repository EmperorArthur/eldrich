Spray Armor,Armor,"This fast armor application comes in a spray can and disperses a smart chemical polymer that sticks to bare flesh (but does not adhere to hair and eyes). The polymer solidifies into a form fitting body armor fabric when exposed to body temperature with the look and feel of a latex suit. Spray armor does not work on synthetic morphs or on clothing or other armor. The color and feel of the armor can be adjusted with electric currents and additional polymers, making it popular among some socialite and nightlife scenes.

Reactive Coating,Armor Mods,"A thick layer of advanced nanotech is applied to the armor, protecting it with a colony of nanobots designed to sense incoming attacks. When an attack strikes the coating, it detonates to disrupt the attack. Bursts and full autofire are treated as a single attack. A reactive coating increases the Armor Value by +5/+5, but each detonation automatically inflicts 1 point of damage on the wearer. Reactive armor also works against melee attacks, but the attacker also suffers 1d10 / 2 (round up) points of damage per attack (armor protects) from the microexplosion. Reactive coating only works against 5 attacks, after which the specialized nanobot hive replenishes the coating at the rate of 1 use per hour.",Moderate,,TRUE,,,,

The range of these transceivers varies widely with environmental factors, but approximates 50 kilometers in atmosphere and 500 kilometers in space (though horizon limits must be kept in mind, being 5 kilometers at ground level on Earth and less on smaller bodies). Lasers are subject to interference from fog, dirt, smoke, and similar visual chaff, while microwaves may be hindered by metallic obstructions.

Chameleon Cloak,Espionage,"This loose, poncho-like cloak contains a network of sensors that perceive wavelengths from microwave to ultra-violet. A similar network of miniature emitters precisely replicate the information its sensors receive, making the wearer seem transparent to those wavelengths. A chameleon cloak allows a character to effectively become invisible as long as they are stationary or not moving faster than a slow walk. When worn by someone moving faster, the cloak still provides a +30 modifier to Infiltration Tests to avoid being seen or noticed. Chameleon cloaks are not effective against radar, x-ray, or gamma-ray sensors. They do hide the character from thermal infrared, however, by absorbing the character's body heat into its heat sink. The cloak can only absorb a character's body heat for one hour before it must emit this heat. Heat emission also requires one hour, during which time the character is easily visible in the thermal infrared spectrum.",Low,,TRUE,EP,315,,
Covert Ops Tool,Espionage,"This handheld device is the ultimate in infiltration technology. It contains both smart matter micromanipulators, cutting tools, and an advanced nanotechnology generator capable of producing nanobots that can bore or cut through almost any material and disable or open almost any electronic lock. Cutting out a lock or boring a 1-millimeter hole in a wall with a COT requires ((Durability + Armor) / 10) seconds. Cutting out a 1-meter diameter hole in a wall requires ((Durability + Armor) / 10) minutes. These same nanobots can later be used to repair this damage so that it is invisible to any but the most careful and detailed examination. A COT can easily open any old-fashioned mechanical lock simply by analyzing it and shaping an appropriate key, though this takes a full Action Turn. It can also open electronic locks by infiltrating them with nanobots that influence the lock's electronics, no matter what authentication system the lock uses. Opening electronic locks takes a full Action Turn, but success is practically guaranteed. Opening an electronic lock in this manner will, however, trigger an alarm and/or be logged as an event.",High,,TRUE,EP,315,,
Cuffband,Espionage,"This smart plastic loop restricts around a prisoner's limbs when activated. If the prisoner struggles, it will tighten more.

Dazzler,Espionage,"The dazzler is a tiny laser system set on a rotating ball. When activated, it consistently spins and emits laser pulses in all directions. These laser pulses are not dangerous, but they detect the lenses of camera systems (including specs, viewers, and bot/synthmorph sensors) and repeatedly zap them with laser pulses of varying strength to overload and dazzle them. For as long as a dazzler is active, any camera system (visual, infrared, and ultraviolet) within line of sight and within 200 meters is blinded.",Moderate,,TRUE,EP,316,,
Disabler,Espionage,"This handy device emits an overloading surge that completely incapacitates and disables a synthetic morph or pod (anything with a cyberbrain) when it is plugged into an access jack and activated. The affected cyberbrain will be unable to function until the signal is deactivated, effectively shutting down the ego (or AI).

Invisibility Cloak,Espionage,"This cloak is made of metamaterials with a negative refractive index, so that light actually bends around it, making it and anything it covers invisible. This invisibility works from the microwave to ultraviolet spectrums, but not against radar or x-rays. The drawback is that anything concealed within the cloak can't see out. This is easily overcome by using external sensor feeds (if available) and entoptics to navigate. Alternately, a small piece of anti-cloak, which cancels the cloak's invisibility properties when touched together, can be used to create a small window to peep out of, though this increases the chance of being spotted. Noticing such a window requires a Perception Test with a -30 modifier.",High,,TRUE,EP,316,,

Microbugs can be set to broadcast continuously, at set intervals, or only when they receive a special signal. If desired, they can also be set to only record if there is movement or voices in the room they are in. Microbugs have adhesive backs and can stick to almost any surface. Microbugs can also establish their location via mesh positioning or GPS, and so double as tracking devices.

Each nanobot contains tiny cameras, microphones, a tiny computer, a radio, and chemical sensors, as well as short legs that allow them to walk and climb at a rate of 5 cm per second. When a character dumps a packet of smart dust in a room, it will cover every surface in the room within 20 minutes, including all furniture and the insides of every drawer and other space that is not airtight. At this point, the smart dust has recorded all data about the room that can be obtained by exceedingly detailed observation, including the DNA of everyone who has visited the room in the last week or two. The smart dust can then either broadcast a brief, highly compressed signal, or it can send all of its information to a few hundred nanobots that then walk to a pre-arranged destination for pickup and downloading by their user. The user need only find a single nanobot with a nanodetector to acquire the information obtained by the smart dust. If ordered to do so, the remaining nanobots can either power down and await further orders or self-destruct in a fashion that turns them into a tiny amount of dust made mostly of metal and silicon.",Moderate,,TRUE,EP,316,,
Stealthed Landing Pod,Espionage,"Sometimes, Firewall teams cannot egocast to a location and must instead physically travel there. If this location is sufficiently dangerous or simply does not welcome visitors, docking a spacecraft may not be possible. In these cases, Firewall teams often use this vehicle. It is designed to be launched from a spacecraft that is passing within 100,000 kilometers of the target. That spacecraft fakes a micrometeor strike or other problem that causes a small explosion and some minor debris. On rare occasions, to insure complete surprise, the spacecraft may actually self-destruct. During this explosion, the landing pod fires a brief burst of its metallic hydrogen rocket to direct it towards its desti- nation, then powers down. The landing pod is heavily stealthed against visual and radar detection, so that it is almost impossible to detect with any sensors if it is not broadcasting or firing its engines (-60 to tests to detect). The landing pod travels toward its destination for between 10 and 100 hours, then approximately 1 minute before it arrives, it fires its engines in a second brief, powerful burst that slows it down to allow it to safely land on its destination. When it fires its engines, sensors on its destination are likely to detect it (+30), but residents of this habitat will hopefully not have time to respond before the operatives can enter the habitat. Landings are often coordinated with mesh intrusions that seek to distract the target's defenses or temporarily disable the local sensors. The landing pod can carry up to six human-sized morphs and has long-term life support facilities to allow it to transport biomorphs. The landing pod has sufficient fuel to allow it to also take off from a habitat and rendezvous with a nearby spacecraft. It also contains a compact radio, microwave, and laser farcaster that allow operatives to remain in secure contact with others and to egocast off the habitat, as long as the users can remain in radio contact with the landing pod. The most expensive landing pods contain a single-use neutrino farcaster capable of broadcasting backups of up to six egos. Using this farcaster destroys the landing pod. Landing pods are designed to dock with habitats, not planets or large moons, and cannot safely land on or take off from any body with a surface gravity of more than 0.04 g.

If the patient's body or medical records contain information about their implants, bioware, or advanced nanotechnology, all of these modifications are also fully restored. Few people suffer injuries serious enough to require a healing vat. Most are used as a safe and easy way to perform bodysculpting or to install implants or bioware. Healing vats use specialized nanomachines to either alter the patient's body or integrate implants or bioware. One advantage of using a healing vat is that no additional healing time is needed, the patient leaves the vat fully recovered from the augmentation and ready to go.

Suborning Swarm,Nanotechnology,"This nanotechnology is highly restricted in most of the solar system, including on all worlds and habitats controlled by the Planetary Consortium. The nanobots in this swarm are programmed to identify all sensors and devices that transmit any signal in the electromagnetic spectrum. This includes radios, ectos, communication links, microbugs, x-ray emitters, etc. Once identified, the swarm's operator can order the nanobots to suborn these sensors and transmitters. Nanomachines in the swarm then attach themselves to all of these devices in the area and can attempt to either disable or tap into them. Disabling sensors and transmitters is rather easy; the swarm simply creates enough electromagnetic interference in and around the device to make it unusable. Make a Simple Test using the swarm's Hardware: Electronics skill of 40. Success indicates all devices have been temporarily disabled. Failure means that a small portion of devices remain active or semi-functional. Large devices may not be disabled. Each swarm can disable sensors and transmitters for up to 1 hour before it must be recharged. Temporary disablement has no long-term damaging effects on the devices. Operators of the devices may attempt to overrride the jamming; in this case the operator must succeed in an Variable Opposed Interfacing Test against the swarm's skill of 40, per the rules for Radio Jamming, p. 262, EP. Tapping into devices is more difficult. In this case, make a regular test using the swarm's Hardware: Electronics skill of 40. It is recommended the game- master apply a single roll to determine the swarm's general effectiveness, and handle individual devices on a case-by-case basis as needed. If successful, the swarm siphons sensor and communication feeds through physical taps in the devices' internal electronics. Note that encrypted transmissions are not decoded, though the operator (or their muse) can attempt to decrypt them on an individual basis. Suborning swarms are ineffective against other nanoswarms (including smart dust) and the sensory and communication implants and enhancements of biomorphs. They are, however, effective against the sensors and communications of robots and synthmorphs, and are especially dangerous to swarmanoids (including skulkers and smart swarms), as they inhibit the ability of the swarmanoid components to communicate.
