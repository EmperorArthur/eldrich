A similar network of miniature emitters precisely replicate the information its sensors receive, making the wearer seem transparent to those wavelengths. A chameleon cloak allows a character to effectively become invisible as long as they are stationary or not moving faster than a slow walk. When worn by someone moving faster, the cloak still provides a +30 modifier to Infiltration Tests to avoid being seen or noticed. Chameleon cloaks are not effective against radar, x-ray, or gamma-ray sensors. They do hide the character from thermal infrared, however, by absorbing the character's body heat into its heat sink.

Heat emission also requires one hour, during which time the character is easily visible in the thermal infrared spectrum.",Low,,TRUE,EP.315,+30 Infiltration
Covert Ops Tool,,Espionage,"This handheld device is the ultimate in infiltration technology. It contains both smart matter micromanipulators, cutting tools, and an advanced nanotechnology generator capable of producing nanobots that can bore or cut through almost any material and disable or open almost any electronic lock.

These same nanobots can later be used to repair this damage so that it is invisible to any but the most careful and detailed examination. A COT can easily open any old-fashioned mechanical lock simply by analyzing it and shaping an appropriate key, though this takes a full Action Turn. It can also open electronic locks by infiltrating them with nanobots that influence the lock's electronics, no matter what authentication system the lock uses.

Each nanobot contains tiny cameras, microphones, a tiny computer, a radio, and chemical sensors, as well as short legs that allow them to walk and climb at a rate of 5 cm per second. When a character dumps a packet of smart dust in a room, it will cover every surface in the room within 20 minutes, including all furniture and the insides of every drawer and other space that is not airtight. At this point, the smart dust has recorded all data about the room that can be obtained by exceedingly detailed observation, including the DNA of everyone who has visited the room in the last week or two. The smart dust can then either broadcast a brief, highly compressed signal, or it can send all of its information to a few hundred nanobots that then walk to a pre-arranged destination for pickup and downloading by their user. The user need only find a single nanobot with a nanodetector to acquire the information obtained by the smart dust. If ordered to do so, the remaining nanobots can either power down and await further orders or self-destruct in a fashion that turns them into a tiny amount of dust made mostly of metal and silicon.",Moderate,,TRUE,EP.316,
Stealthed Landing Pod,,Espionage,"Sometimes, Firewall teams cannot egocast to a location and must instead physically travel there. If this location is sufficiently dangerous or simply does not welcome visitors, docking a spacecraft may not be possible. In these cases, Firewall teams often use this vehicle. It is designed to be launched from a spacecraft that is passing within 100,000 kilometers of the target. That spacecraft fakes a micrometeor strike or other problem that causes a small explosion and some minor debris. On rare occasions, to insure complete surprise, the spacecraft may actually self-destruct. During this explosion, the landing pod fires a brief burst of its metallic hydrogen rocket to direct it towards its desti- nation, then powers down. The landing pod is heavily stealthed against visual and radar detection, so that it is almost impossible to detect with any sensors if it is not broadcasting or firing its engines (-60 to tests to detect). The landing pod travels toward its destination for between 10 and 100 hours, then approximately 1 minute before it arrives, it fires its engines in a second brief, powerful burst that slows it down to allow it to safely land on its destination. When it fires its engines, sensors on its destination are likely to detect it (+30), but residents of this habitat will hopefully not have time to respond before the operatives can enter the habitat. Landings are often coordinated with mesh intrusions that seek to distract the target's defenses or temporarily disable the local sensors. The landing pod can carry up to six human-sized morphs and has long-term life support facilities to allow it to transport biomorphs. The landing pod has sufficient fuel to allow it to also take off from a habitat and rendezvous with a nearby spacecraft. It also contains a compact radio, microwave, and laser farcaster that allow operatives to remain in secure contact with others and to egocast off the habitat, as long as the users can remain in radio contact with the landing pod. The most expensive landing pods contain a single-use neutrino farcaster capable of broadcasting backups of up to six egos. Using this farcaster destroys the landing pod. Landing pods are designed to dock with habitats, not planets or large moons, and cannot safely land on or take off from any body with a surface gravity of more than 0.04 g.

As long as the patient is alive when they are place in the healing vat, they will not only survive, but emerge without a scratch. A healing vat can even take a severed head (as long as it has been stabilized by medichines or nanotech first aid) and regrow an entire body based on the head's genetics. If the patient's body or medical records contain information about their implants, bioware, or advanced nanotechnology, all of these modifications are also fully restored. Few people suffer injuries serious enough to require a healing vat. Most are used as a safe and easy way to perform bodysculpting or to install implants or bioware.

Suborning Swarm,,Nanotechnology,"This nanotechnology is highly restricted in most of the solar system, including on all worlds and habitats controlled by the Planetary Consortium. The nanobots in this swarm are programmed to identify all sensors and devices that transmit any signal in the electromagnetic spectrum. This includes radios, ectos, communication links, microbugs, x-ray emitters, etc. Once identified, the swarm's operator can order the nanobots to suborn these sensors and transmitters. Nanomachines in the swarm then attach themselves to all of these devices in the area and can attempt to either disable or tap into them.

Disabling sensors and transmitters is rather easy; the swarm simply creates enough electromagnetic interference in and around the device to make it unusable. Make a Simple Test using the swarm's Hardware: Electronics skill of 40. Success indicates all devices have been temporarily disabled. Failure means that a small portion of devices remain active or semi-functional. Large devices may not be disabled. Each swarm can disable sensors and transmitters for up to 1 hour before it must be recharged. Temporary disablement has no long-term damaging effects on the devices. Operators of the devices may attempt to overrride the jamming; in this case the operator must succeed in an Variable Opposed Interfacing Test against the swarm's skill of 40, per the rules for Radio Jamming, p. 262, EP.

Tapping into devices is more difficult. In this case, make a regular test using the swarm's Hardware: Electronics skill of 40. It is recommended the game- master apply a single roll to determine the swarm's general effectiveness, and handle individual devices on a case-by-case basis as needed. If successful, the swarm siphons sensor and communication feeds through physical taps in the devices' internal electronics. Note that encrypted transmissions are not decoded, though the operator (or their muse) can attempt to decrypt them on an individual basis.

Suborning swarms are ineffective against other nanoswarms (including smart dust) and the sensory and communication implants and enhancements of biomorphs.

The digital scanner model plugs into the access jacks of a pod or synthmorph or establishes a wireless connection with the morph's basic mesh inserts. With analog scanners, a band is placed around the subject's head to measure brain activity with fMRI. The analog version only works on morphs with biological brains (meaning it doesn't work on pods or cyberbrained biomorphs but does work on biocore morphs).

The subject's responses to questioning are matched against a database of patterns known to indicate deception. In game terms, the scanner makes an Opposed Test, pitting its Perception 60 against the target's Deception skill; success indicates it detects falsehoods. Deception scanners can be used to monitor a subject's response patterns over time to increase their likelihood of spotting lies. For each hour a scanner is used on the same subject, apply a cumulative +10 modifier to its Perception Test, up to a maximum of +30. Note that subjects who are emotionally distressed, suffer from mental disorders, or have undergone physical exertion are harder to read; gamemasters should apply a -10 to -30 to the Perception Test as they feel appropriate. Subjects with edited memories may be unaware they are telling falsehoods and will not fail the test.

In many jurisdictions, failure on a deception scanner is not enough to gain a conviction and can't be used in court, as they are known to be only partially reliable and sometimes return false positives.

In order to create a safe zone for an encampment in an alien environment, gatecrashers may deploy a bio-defense unit (BDU). This device consists of an advanced nanotech hive that deploys a nanobot swarm over a small area, specifically designed to destroy and break down all life or other complex organic molecules that are alien or toxic/dangerous to transhumans. The nanobots produced by this unit have no effect on any Earth-derived life or on any safe compounds they produce.

However, all known alien life possesses biochemistries that are highly distinctive and so a BDU can easily destroy all non-Earth life without risking any harm to gatecrashers or any pets, test animals, or biological compounds they bring with them from the solar system. The operator can also add specific alien life forms and compounds to the list of targets that the BDU will specifically not attack. 

The BDU is a small 15-centimeter hemisphere that contains the hive and a swarm of nanobots. When activated, the swarm deploys over an area 20 meters in diameter (or less if the operator desires).

Each rod contains a series of infrared, radar, and ultrasonic sensors as well as powerful miniature speakers, a stunner, and a microwave agonizer capable of ring in both normal and “roast” mode (p. 339, EP). To use this device, the operator places the four rods upright in a square or rectangle around the camp or other area that they wish to protect. Each rod can be as far as 30 meters from the two nearest rods. Additional defense beacon packs may be deployed to cover a larger perimeter. The operator then designates those individuals and devices that are allowed to freely cross the barrier created by these rods and also determines the minimum size of intruders that will be defended against and the level of defense. Once in place, defense beacons warn everyone inside the camp, using either speakers or radio, of any intruders either coming within 30 meters or attempting to cross the invisible fence created by the four rods. Also, defense beacons can be programmed to use the stunners or microwave agonizers against any intruders (they have Beam Weapons skill 40). Meanwhile, the inhabitants of the camp can walk in or out of the protected area without harm or annoyance.",Moderate,,TRUE,GC.157,
Electrogravitic Net,,Survival Gear,"Also called a safety net, this fail-safe system uses electric fields to counter gravity when falling. While the system is not able to actually levitate heavy objects, it will slow down a fall enough that the user can land safely if the gravitational force is not too high (the fall height is not greater than 50 meters in 1G). Generating these electric fields consumes a lot of energy, so the net is only charged for one use only and needs to be recharged afterwards.",Moderate,,TRUE,EP.332,

Emergency Rations,,Survival Gear,"Sometimes all technology fails. Even the best makers and life support systems can break down or be disabled by hostile actions. Since alien plants and animals are almost universally inedible, some gatecrashers carry along a supply of compressed emergency rations. The most common form of emergency food is a mini-sized package of 9 small bars that supply complete calories and nutrition for a total of 3 full days.

Healing Pod,,Survival Gear,"Healing vats are too expensive and bulky for most gate- crashers to carry with them. However, both medichines and nanobandages heal wounds at a much slower rate. Also, neither of these two types of medical technology can deal with the most severely wounded morphs. Instead, both place such morphs in medical stasis. Since gatecrashers can rarely afford to either wait several days to heal or to carry around a comrade in medical stasis, a disposable healing pod was developed. This small-sized device contains a wide variety of advanced medical repair and life support nanotechnology.

To use this device, the patient must either be in a functional vacsuit or the healing pod must be connected to a Life-Support Pack (p. 159) and the patient placed into a morph-sized sack that is included with the device. When the healing pod is activated, the unit’s compressed nanobots swarm out, envelop the patient, and thoroughly infiltrate their body. These nanobots heal the patient with the same speed and effectiveness as a healing vat (p. 326, EP). 

A version of the healing pod exists that is designed to repair synthmorphs. It does not require a working vacsuit or an LSP and comes with a limited supply of the raw materials needed for synthmorph repair. A single healing pod can heal either biomorphs or synthmorphs, not both. 

Healing pods can be re-used, but their nanotech is only able to heal a total of 10 wounds. Once a healing pod has healed that many wounds, the medical nanobots have been used up and a new healing pod must be acquired.",Moderate,,TRUE,GC.159,

A life-support pack (LSP) is a thick belt that contains a small nuclear battery as well as advanced  lters and a specialized maker that allow it to supply the wearer with pure air for up to 30 days. If the wearer periodically adds water or ice or spends time in an atmosphere containing oxygen, even if this oxygen is part of carbon dioxide or some other gas, then the LSP automatically replenishes its oxygen supply and can continue to provide air for the wearer for the next two years. The LSP’s nuclear battery is also designed to interface with the vacsuit it is attached to, allowing it to power that suit for a similar length of time. LSPs can be worn with either light or standard vacsuits, but are most useful when used with standard vacsuits, since they also provide the wearer with food and water.",Moderate,,TRUE,GC.159,
Nanobandage,,Survival Gear,"Characters without medichines must rely on external sources of healing. The most common option is the nanobandage a plum-sized advanced nanotechnology generator built into a reusable, self-sterilizing bandage. It can treat all forms of injury and illness, from poisoning to burns to trauma. Characters simply apply the bandage to the wound and let the nanobots do the work. It removes pain and discomfort and speeds healing. For especially severe injuries, physical first aid such as setting bones and removing projectiles may be necessary (gamemaster's choice).

Repair Spray,,Survival Gear,"This nanobot generator creates nanobots designed to repair synthmorphs, vehicles, and other common objects. Repair spray contains the specifications and plans for almost all commonly used synthmorphs and devices and is a ubiquitous household item. If it does not contain the specifications for something it is being used to repair, it must query the object's voice for these details, otherwise it cannot repair it. Simply touch it to the damaged area, push the button on top, and it sprays out a number of nanobots sufficient to make repairs. These nanobots repair 1d10 points of damage per 2 hours. Once all damage is restored, the nanobots repair wounds at the rate of 1 per day. Repair spray also cleans and polishes items and returns them to a pristine and new state. Repair spray is not effective on any object with more than 3 wounds, but it provides a +30 to all repair rolls on anything too badly damaged for it to fully repair.",Low,,TRUE,EP.333,

It can produce up to 2 kilometers of 0.2 millimeter diameter line than can support up to 250 kilograms before it needs more raw materials. The spindle can produce up to 20 meters of cable every second. It can produce line in a continuous length or cut the cable it produces to any length. Spindles can also reabsorb their cable, retracting it at a rate of 5 m per second. As long as it is recharged and has small amounts of additional material added every 1,000 hours of use, a spindle can keep producing and retracting cable indefinitely. By setting the maximum production speed at 10 m/second a character with a spindle can safely jump off a building and land safely, using the cable to slow their descent.",Moderate,,TRUE,EP.333,

Adaptive Interface,,Xenoarcheology Gear,"One of the most hoped-for finds on any gatecrashing expedition is any piece of functional alien electronics—especially any alien data storage medium still containing data. In the rare circumstances that such a relic is found, the adaptive interface is the tool designed to enable transhumans to understand, activate, and potentially interact with it.

This medium-sized device includes a series of smart-material connectors that allow this unit to be connected to almost any conceivable piece of technology. It is also equipped with sensors and a small nanoswarm that can analyze the device’s structure and otherwise try to discern its inner workings. Once connected, the adaptive interface sends minute amounts of power into the alien device, monitors all outputs, and systematically attempts to identify and map the circuitry and logic patterns in the device as well as the safe amount and type of current used to power it. The interface’s AI compares the scans and any detected data structures to databases of known and speculated designs (Academics: Computer Science 80, Academics: Electrical Engineering 80, Academics: Xenodata 60, Infosec 40, Interfacing 40, Programming 40).

An adaptive interface can be set up to analyze on its own (use the AI’s skills) or a character can take advantage of it to conduct their own study (with the  AI providing teamwork). Attempts to figure out how to activate or use an alien device, read data on a relic, figure out an item’s purpose, etc. are Task Actions with a suggested timeframe of at least 1 hour and quite possibly longer. The alien nature of most devices applies a –30 modifier to such tests. The gamemaster should adjust this timeframe and apply additional modifiers as appropriate to the device.

While engaged in probing an alien device, the adaptive interface enters into an offline mode, severing all wireless connections; this is safety feature to prevent the interface from spreading an infection to other devices.

The primary limit on this unit is that it is not designed to work with biological technology or with nanotechnology considerably in advance of those available to transhumanity. As a result, this unit cannot be used on bluetrees, myst trees, or any similar non-standard devices.",High,,TRUE,GC.160,
